Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians

Preface
When we were children, the word 'Doctor' meant only one thing - our "Local family
doctor." He was called family doctor because he in many ways was a part of the
family. He was a comforting figure who took care of our fevers, coughs, rashes,
diarrheas, pains and anything else we may have from bronchial asthma to chicken
pox. If there was any medical emergency at home he was the first person to be called.
One was always sure that he would give us relief, whatever the reason and whatever
it was that we were suffering from. His mere presence was comforting. He knew all
about our family and kept track of all our health related issues. However, in the
recent past the community of family physicians is diminishing and losing its relevance
in the overall scheme of medical practice. Specialization, super-specialization, fancy
hospitals and access to medical information on the internet has resulted in patient's
directly reaching specialists and therefore bypassing the family physician who in
earlier years was the link between the family and the all aspects of medical care. This
has its disadvantages since the family physicians looked at the patient's as a whole
and in context to the rest of the family and therefore, recommended medical advice
in a more holistic fashion.
This book has therefore, been written for family physicians to update them on what
is happening in the field of neurological disorders. Most serious neurological
conditions have early warning signs and it is important, that family physicians pick
up these signs so that early diagnosis through relevant investigations and correct
treatments through appropriate referrals can be made. These can be life saving in
many neurological conditions. Therefore this book starts with a sections on symptoms
and elaborates on what these symptoms can be due to. There have been many rapid
advances in the pharmacological treatments of neurological problems and a whole
lot of new investigations are now available. Therefore, separate sections on these
two important aspects have been included in the book. This will help family physicians
make better informed prescriptions and ask for more focused investigations. There
is a section on how to manage emergencies in the clinic as well as a separate section
on some of the important neurological conditions such as stroke, brain tumors etc.
The recent few years have also seen many new developments in treatments of
neurological conditions that were earlier considered incurable. The availability of
safer and more effective surgical techniques such as Microneurosurgery and Minimally
invasive neurosurgery along with the recent evolution of revolutionary technologies
such as Stem Cell Therapy have completely changed the overall methods of
management as well as prognosis in the management of neurological disorders. We
have therefore, included a section on recent advances so that family physicians can
guide their patient's as to what are the best available treatments for their ailments.
Wishing all our family physician friends and colleagues - 'A Happy and Informative
Reading'!

Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Dr. Gian Chand Sharma (New Delhi)
(1903 - 1972)
A Family Physician, General Practitioner from Karol
Bagh, New Delhi who became my role model as to how
a doctor should be.
From whom I learnt what is caring, compassion, healing
and selfless service
Whose words to me I still remember : "Never look at a
patient as a source of 5 rupees. Patients come to a doctor in pain
and suffering. Ease this suffering and god will look after your
needs"
Shri Sai Das Sharma, (Itarsi Madhya Pradesh)
(1887 -1966 )
A Police Officer from Itarsi, Madhya Pradesh whose last
wish inspired me to take up medicine as a career.
From the story of whose life I learnt the meaning of the
words integrity, character, honesty, devotion and
commitment.
Whose suffering and death from a late diagnosed
malignancy taught me of the important role that a family
physician could make in the life’s of ordinary people by
making early diagnosis of serious conditions.

1. Headache
Headache is one of the most common presenting symptoms of neurological disorders.
Whereas the majority of them are innocuous and need only symptomatic treatment,
some can be a sign of serious underlying disorders and therefore headaches should
always be taken seriously. A headache is a pain in the head radiating above the eyes
or the ears, behind the head or in the back of the upper neck.
When treating a patient with headache the first question in our mind should be - is it
a Primary headache or is it a Secondary headache?
Primary headaches are not associated with any underlying major disease. Examples
of primary headaches are tension headaches, migraine and Cluster headches.
Secondary headaches are caused due to some other underlying disease. These may
be minor ones such as uncorrected ophthalmic refractory error, sinusitis, withdrawal
from caffeine and discontinuation of analgesics. They may also be symptomatic of
major illnesses such as brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, and subarachnoid
hemorrhages.
Fig. 1.1
Common types of Headaches:
1.
Tension Headache:
It is the most common type of headache and occurs due to muscle tension producing
ischemia of the scalp and facial muscles. It may have a band like discomfort and is not
associated by any other symptom, patient is able to continue his/her normal activity.
This type of headache builds slowly and may become severe.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
20
These are generalized headaches of gradual onset and can be of mild to moderate
severity. They are described by the patients as aching or pressure type of headache
and are always non pulsatile. They last from one to two hours and occur during the
later part of the day. They may be associated with grinding of the teeth, lack of sleep
and difficulty in concentration. There is always some major underlying emotional or
psychological cause which may be family or work related. Neurological examination
does not reveal any abnormality.
Investigations: None
Treatment:
[1]
Paracetamol 500mg 1 TDS for mild pain,
[2]
Combination of Paracetamol & Codeine 1 TDS for mild to moderate pain,
[3]
Paracetamol +Acelofenac 1BD for moderate pain
[4]
Naproxen 1 BD for moderate to severe pain
[6]
Amitriptyline 25 mg 1 QHS if difficulty to sleep
[7]
Counseling / relaxation exercises / tranquilizers/ lifestyle changes may be helpful.
Referal:
Non responsive headaches to regular treatment or persistent severe progressive
headache.
2.
Migraine Headache
Migraine is an inflammatory disorder of the brain and its blood vessels, which results
in hyper reactivity of the cerebral blood vessels. It is classified as a common migraine
(migraine without aura), classical migraine (migraine with aura) and complex migraine.
Classical migraine headaches are throbbing in nature, mostly unilateral and often
associated with flashes of light. Aura, nausea and vomiting, photo/phonophobia,
scalp tenderness may be present in some of the cases. In the complicated migraine
there are associated neurological signs and symptoms caused by vasoconstriction of
intracranial vessels such as confusion, amnesia, transient monocular blindness,
hemiparesis and limb paraesthesias. Migraine can be precipitated by red
wine,menses,hunger,insomnia,perfumes, etc. A migraine typically lasts from 4 to 72
hours.
Investigations:
None for common or classical migraine. In complex migraine CT Scan/MRI scan may
be done to rule out structural lesions if there is no relief.
Treatment:
Symptomatic relief (once attack starts). [1] Analgesics & NSAID’s [2] Rest in a quiet,
21
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
dark room if possible, [3] Triptans-are prescribed for acute attack in the early stage.
They should not be given in complicated migraine. (Sumatriptan 25mg, Zolmitriptan
5mg, Rizatriptan 5mg [4] Ergotamines (Dihydro ergotamine preferred in status
migraine), [5] Isometheptene [6] Sedatives, [7]Antiemetics
(Practical management for acute attack:- :[1] Rizatriptan 10 mg stat followed by
Naproxen and Tab Pantoprazole for 1-2 days)
Prevention:
[1]
Identify and avoid trigger factors such as exposure to sunlight, delayed meals,
delayed sleep, foods such as caffeine, cheese, chocolates, chinese food etc
[2]
Prophylactic medications-Those patients who have more than one migraine per
week should be put on prophylactic medications such as B-blockers, calcium
channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, SSRI’s ,anticonvulsants.
Practical management for migraine prophalaxis: Propranolol slow release 40 mg
one tablet in the morning for 3 months + Amitryptline 10mg 1 hs or Flunarizine
10 mg HS
Referal:
Persistent migraine not responding to medications and migraine with associated other
signs.
3.
Headache due to uncorrected refractory error
The headache comes as after watching TV, reading for long. Is dull, aching, bilateral
and may be bifrontal or generalized.
Investigations: None
Treatment: Analgesics
Referal:
Ophthalmologist or an optician for correction.
4.
Headache due to Sinusitis
These are bifrontal headaches which are gradual in onset, moderate in severity, dull
and boring in nature and associated with pain or pressure in the face. There is history
of frequent cold with nasal discharge. Presence of tenderness on the sinuses
(frontal,maxillary), sides of the nose is noticed on examination.
Investigations:
[1]
Plain X-ray of Paranasal sinuses (PNS), [2] CT Scan PNS
Treatment:
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
22
[1]
Analgesics, [2]Antihistaminic, [3] Antibiotics – All For seven days.
Practical management:-a combination of diclofenac tds, sulfamethoxazole +
trimethoprim or amoxicillin and clavulanate – bd, fexofenadine (allegra) or
pheniramine (avil) –qhs is a good combination.
Referal:
If there is no improvement even after seven days of the above treatment then refer
to ENT surgeon for evaluation.
5. Headaches due to Hypertension
One of the early signs of Hypertension are Headaches. The classical feature of
Hypertension  headaches is that they occur early in the morning. They may   present
as pressure just behind the eyes or as headaches at the back of the head. They are
sometimes associated by dizziness and palpitations . The headache may be mild or
severe and occur more commonly in women than men.  Any patient over 50 presenting
with morning headaches should always have their blood pressure checked.
Investigations:
Regular monitoring of BP.
ECG, 2 D Echo , Stress test , Lipid Profile and Other cardiac investigations may be
indicated in some cases.
Treatment :-
No analgesics
Medications for hypertension
Counseling for Lifestyle changes to reduce stress levels
Referral
If despite the above the BP remains high and headaches persist then the patient
should be refereed to a cardiologist for further management.
It is important to note that Hypertension headaches are one type of headaches for
which painkillers  should not be given since they suppress only the symptoms and do
not take care of the serious issue of hypertension. The treatment of hypertension
headaches is control of hypertension and it has been noted that once the blood pressure
is lower,  the headache get relieved.
6) Cluster headache
These are episodic pain attacks at periorbital region it is usually excrutiating and
deep and pulsatile in nature,pain is unilateral and lasts for 30 minutes to 2 hours.there
are associated symptoms like lacrimation,redness of eye,nasal stuffiness,ptosis,and
nausea.Alcohol provokes the attack.
23
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Treatment:
Acute attack- [1] 100% oxygen for 10-15 mins, [2] Sumatriptan 6mg subcutaneous
injection stat.
Prevention:
Prednisone 40mg/day for 5 days tapered over 3 weeks. [2] Indomethacin 75 mg/
day [3] others-lithium and ergotamine.
6) Trigeminal Neuralgia
Unilateral severe lancinating pain around the face, lips, gums. It is aggravated by a
tickle or touch, pain burst happen over seconds to minutes with a refractory period
afterwards. There may be associated flushing, salivation or lacrimation.
Investigation:
MRI/ CT scan must be done to rule out CP angle tumor.
Treatment:
[1] carbamazepine 100 mg BD [2] gabapentin 100 mg TDS [3] Others- Antidepressants-
Ametreptonin, fluoxetine, clonazepam. [4] Avoid stimulation of trigger zone by air,
heat or cold [5] In some cases surgical intervention may be required- nerve block,
surgical decompression.
Referral:
Should be referred to neurophysician or neurosurgeon.
Fig. 1.2
Headaches due to serious underlying conditions:
Conditions causing secondary headaches are brain stroke, subarachnoid intracranial
hemorrhage , brain tumors, meningitis, severe high blood pressure. These can cause
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
24
serious brain damage or even death. Thus, timely and accurate diagnosis of secondary
headaches is crucial. Special blood tests, brain scans, and lumbar puncture (spinal
tap) are necessary to establish these diagnoses. One should rely upon information
obtained from the initial patient history and physical examination.
Common causes of serious headache:
1)
Sentinel headache due to subarachnoid haemorrhage
Sentinel headache (SH) is characterized as sudden (thunderclap headache), intense,
and persistent headache, preceding spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
by days or weeks. It is often described as the “worst headache of my life”. It is the
most common symptom to manifest 10-20 days before rupture of an aneurysm. In
addition to headaches, sentinel leaks may produce nausea, vomiting, photophobia,
malaise, or neck pain. These symptoms can easily be ignored by a physician. Therefore,
a high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose this type of headache due to
subarachnoid haemorrhage.
The diagnosis of SAH should be based upon the following seven characteristics:
•
Aged >=40 years
•
Witnessed loss of consciousness
•
Complaint of neck pain or stiffness
•
Onset of manifestations with exertion
•
Arrival by ambulance
•
Vomiting
•
Diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm
Hg
The possibility of SAH should be suspected if any one or more of these is present
along with acute nontraumatic headache which reaches maximum intensity within
one hour, and the patient be referred to a neurophysician and hospitalized
immediately.
Fig. 1.3
25
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
2)
Meningitis
Acute severe type of headache with neck stiffness and fever suggests meningitis.
Meningitis may be mistaken as migraine sometimes due to the chief symptoms like
pounding headache, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, etc. This requires hospitalisation
and so patient should be referered to neurology department.
3)
Tumours
Profound pounding dull, aching, or throbbing headache of medium intensity which
worsens with exertion and change of position and may be associated with nausea or
vomiting may suggest an intracranial tumour. The headaches may become more
frequent, increasing in severity, and not easily relieved. Patient gets disturbed from
sleep. They can also be worsened by coughing or sneezing and persistently occur on
the same side often. Vomiting that precedes headache is a characteristic of posterior
fossa tumours. This type of headache should be immediately investigated and brought
to the concern of a neurophysician or neurosurgeon.
4)
Stroke
Headache with symptoms such as acute weakness and numbness in the limbs and/or
face, nausea, vomiting, an altered level of consciousness, may indicate increased
intracranial pressure and are more common with hemorrhagic strokes and large
ischemic strokes.
A detailed medical history of patient for identifying following risk factors of stroke
should be acquired to suspect a stroke:
•
Hypertension
•
Diabetes mellitus
•
Tobacco use
•
High cholesterol
•
History of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass, or atrial
fibrillation
•
Recent trauma
•
Coagulopathies
•
Illicit drug use (especially cocaine)
•
Migraines
•
Oral contraceptive use
In the presence of these risk factors and clinical presentation, the patient should be
immediately hospitalized to prevent stroke and its life threatening effects.
5)
Temporal arteritis
It is an inflammatory condition of arteries which involves the extracranial carotid
circulation. Temporal arteritis presents with classical symptoms - headache, jaw
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
26
claudication, scalp tenderness, and
visual 
disturbances. 
Fever,
myalgia, anorexia, weight loss,
anemia, and malaise may also
occur as systemic inflammatory
response. Temoral arteritis should
be distinguished from systemic
infections, connective tissue
diseases, 
and 
compressive
intracranial malignancies, etc by
further clinical examination, blood
and 
CSF 
testing, 
and
neuroimaging. Temporal arteritis
usually occurs in older people and
is extremely rare in individuals
younger than 50 years of age, and
present with visual changes. If not
treated, patient may develop partial or complete blindness due to involvement of
ophthalmic artery or its branches. Therefore, immediate hospitalisation and referral
is a must in this case.
Information that should be taken by the doctor includes:
1.
The mode of onset of the headache: For example, patients with a subarachnoid
hemorrhage typically report having a sudden onset of severe headache (“the
worst headache ever”).
2.
The location of the headache: (on one side or both sides of the head). Headaches
that persistently occur on the same side often are secondary headaches associated
with one sided lesions such as brain tumors.
3.
Associated fever and neck stiffness: Bacterial meningitis is a rapidly progressive
and life-threatening disease with fever, headaches, stiff neck, and deterioration
in mental function.
4.
Associated mental deterioration, seizures, or weakness of the extremities or
face, which can be symptoms of brain tumors.
5.
Associated temporary weakness of the extremities or facial muscles, which can
be symptoms of transient ischemic attacks.
6.
Recent head injury: Headaches soon after injury to the head may be caused by
subdural or epidural hematomas.
7.
The age of the patient: Temporal arteritis typically occurs in older people and is
extremely rare in individuals younger than 50.
Headaches those are different in severity and intensity need urgent attention,
Fig. 1.4

Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
investigations and reference.
Investigations:
[1]
CT scan of the head. Should be done whenever the headache sis different in
severity and character and also for late onset headches. CT scan of the head is useful
for detecting accumulation of blood such as subdural hematomas and subarachnoid
hemorrhages. It is moderately useful in detecting brain tumors and strokes not due
to hemorrhage.[2] MRI scan of the head. An MRI scan of the head can detect infections
of the brain, strokes and tumors. It is not so useful for acute hemorrhage. [3] Lumbar
puncture. In some patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, CT scans are normal, and
lumbar punctures are necessary to demonstrate blood from the hemorrhage that has
spread throughout the cerebro-spinal fluid(CSF). CSF is also useful for diagnosis of
meningitis, it shows decreased sugar levels, increased proteins and increased cells (if
major are polymorphs then it suggests Bacterial meningitis and if there are
lymphocytes then it suggests Tubercular meningitis).
Treatment:
Specific treatment of the cause of the headache.
Referal:
Refer to Neurophysician or Neurosurgeon.
Drugs useful in symptomatic treatment of headache:
(A) General
[1] Paracetamol, [2] Paracetamol+ codeine, [3]Paracetamol +Acelofenac [4] Naproxen
[5] Diclofenac (Brufen is not useful in headaches, except those due to sinusitits, and
can in fact make some headaches worse)
(B) Specific
[1]Anti Migraine therapy, [2] Steroids, [3] Muscle relaxants, [4] Tricyclic anti
depressants, [5] Anticonvulsants
Warning signs
1)
Headache with fever with neck stiffness.
2)
Sudden serious acute headache associated with vomiting and neck stiffness.
3)
Headache after lumbar puncture which is relieved by lying down this type of
headache is called spinal headache which is relieved by analgesics and plenty of
fluids
4)
Headache with projectile vomiting suspect for increased intracranial pressure
this type of headache may be worst on lying down.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
28
5)
Headache which is localised and aggravated on chewing temporal arteritis.
6)
Headache with neurodeficit.
7)
Headache with high BP. More than 160/100
Summary
1] Sometimes a headache is a warning sign of something serious like stroke,
brain tumors etc. so it should not be taken lightly. One should act promptly in
diagnosing as well as treating the underlying cause. [2] Any patients whose
headaches do not get relieved or worsen within 3 days of initial management
should have a CT Scan done and should be referred to a Neurosurgeon or
Neurophysician. [3] Sudden onset severe headaches are a sign of a possibly
serious underlying disorder and must be investigated with a  scan or referred
to a Neuro consultant immediately. [4] for mild headaches the investigations
to be done are (a) ESR, (b) Xrays PNS, (c) Check up by optician / opthalmologist
for refractory error, [5] for severe headaches a CT Scan brain (plain & contrast)
should be done.

2. Giddiness
Giddiness or lightheadedness, a very common symptom seen in practise, is a term
used to describe a sensation of altered orientation in space usually described by the
patient as “chakar”. Giddiness, lightheadedness, disequilibrium and syncope are often
mistaken for one another; most often caused by relative decrease in sensorium and
are caused by different conditions.
The important enquires to be made are (a) whether there is a sense of the external
environment rotating or spinning, (b) whether there is an associated loss of
consciousness and (c) whether there are any preexisting medical, cardiac or
neurological disorders.
A)
Vertigo/ Dizziness is hallucination of movements which results in sensation of
external environment spinning and rotating and is mostly caused by an otological
disorder and sometimes by CNS disorders.
B)
Disequilibrium is a sense of imbalance observed while walking due to cerebellar
or spinal disorders effecting sensory proprioception.
C)
Syncope which is loss of consciousness occurs secondary to inadequate cerebral
profusion, a common cause of which is postural hypertension and cardiogenic
factors.
Fig. 2.1
31
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Examination
1)
Physician should check the blood pressure in all positions to see postural
hypotension.
2)
Neurological examination to rule out any neurological deficit and to rule out
secondary cause
3)
ENT for otitis media or labyranthitis
4)
Eye examination-to look for nystagmus,refractive error any visual deficit
5)
ECG to rule arrhythmias and other causes.
6)
See on what medications patient is on,medications as many of the drugs itself
can cause dizziness.
Causes of Vertigo:
The three systems that are involved are the brain, the cervical spine and the inner
ear.
1.
Inner ear or vestibular dysfunction:
a.
BPPV (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo):
It is caused by displacement of otoconia into the posterior semi circular canal and it
manifests as a rotational dizziness. The patient complains that the surroundings seem
to rotate.
The key distinguishing feature is that it is positional. There is severe vertigo only in
same positions of the head (i.e. right or left). In addition to vertigo, symptoms of
BPPV may include dizziness (lightheadedness), imbalance, difficulty concentrating,
and nausea.
Fig. 2.2
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
32
Provocative factors: Vertigo symptoms are precipitated by changing the head’s position
with respect to gravity like looking up, rolling over or getting out of bed.
Causes of BPPV in young adults include head injury, and age-related degeneration
of the otolithic membrane in older adults, surgical trauma, etc. It may also develop
after long periods of inactivity.
Diagnosis: BPPV is diagnosed based on medical history, physical examination,
vestibular and auditory tests. If vertigo does not respond to standard medicine or
there are other associated neurological signs, then workup needs to be done to rule
out other diagnoses.
1.
Vestibular tests which include the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and the Supine Roll
test, observe the nystagmus elicited in response to a change in head position.
The semicircular canal involved in vertigo can be identified by these tests.
2.
Audiogram: if it shows sensory neural deafness then get the following
a.
SISI: if positive suggests a cochlear problem.
b.
TDT testing: positive suggests a retrocochlear problem
3.
An MRI scan will be needed to rule out other problems such as a stroke or brain
tumour. MRI brain with gadolinium contrast can be ordered to evaluate for C P
angle tumor.
4.
Blood tests: CBC and serum electrolytes
Treatment:
[1]
Tb Meclizine 25 to 50 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours
[2]
Perform Epley’s maneuver:
Start with patient sitting on couch. Turn patient’s head (45 degrees) toward
affected side. Pause in this position for 30 seconds. Lie patient flat, support the
head throughout. Head remains turned to affected side and is hanging off end
of couch. Pause in this position for 30 seconds. Turn the patient’s head (90 degrees)
towards the good ear. Pause in this position for 30 seconds. Keeping head looking
in same direction, ask patient to gently move to lie on shoulder of good side,
looking at floor, with chin close to shoulder. Pause in this position for 30 seconds.
Gently bring patient to sitting position. Ensure head position does not change
relative to trunk. Pause for 30 seconds. Finally, turn head to centre and flex neck
to put chin on chest in one movement. Pause for 30 seconds
33
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Fig. 2.3
[3]
Vestibular rehabilitation
Precautions: The patient should be asked to sleep in an elevated position with two
or more pillows and not on the side of the treated ear. A cervical collar should be
given to avoid quick movements like looking up or down or head rotation.
Referal : Refer to ENT consultant.
b.
Meniere’s disease:
It is caused by collection of fluid in the inner ear. Presents with a combination of
severe vertigo, tinnitus and nausea.
Causes
Cause is unknown, recent theory is intracranial compression of balance nerve by
blood vessel
Signs & symptoms
•
Hearing loss
•
Vertigo
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
34
•
Ear fullness
•
During severe attack there may be pallor, sweating, nausea, vomiting and
falling.
Investigations: Audiogram
Treatment: [1] Vertin TDS x 7 days. [2] Salt restriction (less than 1 to 2 gms sodium/
day) [3] Others- diuretics (most commonly hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene)
Intratympanic dexamethasone or gentamicin,[4] In severe cases endolymphatic sac
surgery
Referal: if no relief then refer to ENT consultant.
c.
Labrinthitis:
Inflammation of the vestibular labyrinth(a system of intercommunicating cavities &
canals in the inner ears). Clinically, patient experiences disturbances of balance and
hearing to varying degrees and may affect 1 or both ears. 
Causes
•
Physiological-mismatch of vestibular,visual and somatosensory systems
triggered by an external stimulus,such as a stop after whirling
turns,heights,motion sickness
•
Pathological-imbalance in vestibular system caused by a lesion within vestibular
pathways
•
Infections-especially viral, mumps
•
Others-Tumors,Vasculitis,Infarction,Ototoxic drugs,Head injury
Investigations : CBC,LFT,blood sugar,creatinine etc
Treatment
[1]
Tb Meclizine 25 to 50 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours
[2]
Tb Domperidone tds
[3]
In some cases, antibiotic or antiviral may be given
Referal: refer to ENT consultant.
d. Vestibular neuritis
Vestibular neuritis is acute, sustained dysfunction of the peripheral vestibular system
which presents as nausea, vomiting, and vertigo, and normal hearing. Vestibular
neuritis is generally distinguished from labyrinthitis by preserved auditory function.
Treatment
Methylprednisolone initially 100 mg orally daily then tapered to 10 mg orally daily
over 3 weeks
35
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
e.
Migrainous vertigo:
Vertigo associated with migraine headache.
Treatment
[1]
Tb Meclizine 25 to 50 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours
[2]
Migraine prophylaxis with serotonin reuptake inhibitor 5-HT1 receptor
agonists(triptans)
2. Cervical Spine
a.
Cervical spondylosis:
In the older age group the most common cause of giddiness is cervical spondylosis.
(this is the most commonly missed problem in routine practise). It is associated with
pain in the back of the neck radiating to head, one of the shoulders and upper limbs
along with tingling and numbness of both hands. In advanced stages wasting and
weakness of the hands may occur.
Investigations:
1.
Lateral and AP x-rays of cervical spine.
2.
MRI cervical spine to be done if degenerative changes seen on the x-rays.
Fig. 2.4
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
36
Treatment:

Management of Cardiovascular Disease
Management is beyond the scope of this book-refer to cardiologist
(B) Disequilibrium
Treatment of underlying cause is described in Section C.
(C) Syncope and pre syncope:
When loss of consciousness is temporary and there is spontaneous recovery it is
called syncope. It may be preceded by symptoms like dizziness or faintness or “the
presyncope”. This occurs due to reduction of blood flow to the brain.
Presyncope symptoms vary in duration and may increase in severity until loss of
consciousness. Symptoms may include light headedness, sweating, pale skin, blurred
vision, nausea, vomiting, etc. These are usually brought about by hypotension with
reduction of cerebral blood flow. Three-fourths of the systemic blood flow is contained
in the venous bed and any interference in venous return may result in reduction in
cardiac output.
Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden
cardiac death, and seizures.
Neurological causes of syncope and pre syncope:
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
38
This condition is also known as ‘neurally mediated hypotension’, ‘the fainting reflex’,
‘vasodepressor syncope’, ‘vasovagal syncope’, or ‘autonomic dysfunction’. The
brainstem structures are supplied by vertebrobasilar arteries, which is responsible to
maintain consciousness and which may cause syncope due to vascular disease.
Those who experience syncope may also have symptoms of focal neurologic ischemia
such as arm and leg weakness, diplopia, ataxia, dysarthria, etc. Neurological causes
should be suspected if headache or dizziness occurs during recovery from syncopal
episodes.
In middle age, neurocardiogenic syncope remains the most frequent cause of syncope.
Common causes of syncope in elderly persons include orthostatic hypotension,
postprandial hypotension, medications, carotid sinus hypersensitivity.
Other forms of neurocardiogenic syncope (so-called situational syncope) related to
deglutition, micturition, defecation, and cough are more common in the middle-aged
or elderly patients than in young patients
Neurocardiogenic syncope may occur in the following situations:
•
after prolonged periods of standing
•
after being in a hot summer weather, a hot crowded room, or a hot shower
•
immediately after exercise 
•
after emotionally stressful situations
•
after having food (since blood flow shifts to the intestinal circulation during
the process of digestion)
How to diagnose
The Physician should look for emergency care in cases of massive internal haemorrhage.
The position of the patient is also important. If a patient has syncope in supine position
it may be due to seizure.
Key clinical features of neurocardiogenic syncope
•
It tends to be situational.
•
It is often recurrent
•
It is often preceded by at least a few seconds of prodromal symptoms.
•
It occurs when the patient is in the upright position, and is resolved and
can be aborted by assuming the supine position.
•
After recovery, patients with neurocardiogenic syncope often complain of
a “washed out” and tired feeling.
Examination
•
Check the blood pressure in supine, sitting and lying down position
39
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
Check the heart rate in supine, sitting and lying down position
•
Cardiac and neurological examination
Investigations:
Tests involve serum electrolytes, glucose and haematocrit, creatinine, etc.
ECG and Echocardiogram to rule out cardiac causes
Management
Non Pharmacological
Patients with frequent episodes of syncope should take extra precaution while climbing
stairs, swimming alone, operating heavy machines, driving. Patients who have lost
consciousness should be placed in recovery position which will help to improve
cerebral flow. Clothing that fits tight around the neck or waist should be loosened.
Patients experiencing neurocardiogenic syncope should avoid situations that predispose
to syncope (e.g., dehydration, stress, alcohol consumption, prolonged standing, and
extremely warm environments). Anxiety management and coping skills should be
taught. It is important to reassure the patient that this is a benign condition.
Pharmacological
Drug therapy is necessary in vasovagal syncope when the episodes are frequent with
associated risks. Metoprolol 25 to 50mg bid, atenolol 25 to 50 qd.
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors like paroxetine 20 to 40 mg qd, or sertraline 25 to 50
mg qd in some patients is helpful.

Summary:
Giddiness can be the presenting symptom of potentially life threatening
conditions. If in doubt get urgent CT scan or MRI and advise admission
with reference to the concerned consultant.
It is very important to differentiate whether the patient has dizziness/
vertigo or syncope because the causes & treatment will vary accordingly.
Syncope is a more serious symptom & therefore has to be evaluated by a
specialist Doctor & patient workup needs to be done immediately.
Vertigo is a common symptom encountered by a family physician. It is
most commonly caused by inner ear disturbances. Therefore, a thorough
ENT checkup is required if the symptoms do not resolve by standard
medicines or are recurrent.
Sample Prescription For Vertigo
Rx
Tb Meclizine 25 mg to 50 mg 4 to 6 hourly
Tb Domperidone 10 mg 1 – 0 – 1

3. Memory Problems
Memory problems include inability to recall past experiences and are divided into
long term and short term memory loss. Loss of recent memory is an important
indication of age related cerebral degeneration and most often goes undiagnosed. It
is important to note that this is a symptom that patient would never complain himself
unless asked. It is the relatives who will confirm on questioning that the patient
forgets immediate past events. Since the patients have very vivid recollection of the
long term events they believe their memory is good, therefore the distinction between
long term and short term memory is very important.
Therefore loss of recent memory is a symptom that all family physicians must
ask their patients (>60) and their relatives. A distinction should be made between
long term memory and short term memory, when obtaining the history of memory
loss.
Causes
1.
Senile dementia
2.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus
3.
Multiple lacunar Infarcts
4.
Alzheimer disease
5.
Multiple sclerosis
6.
Other rare degenerative disorders
Mechanism of recent loss of memory
Ccerebral atrophy and degeneration of medial temporal lobe result in gradual decline
of memory function. A common triad of symptoms i.e. loss of recent memory, urinary
incontinence and ataxia definitely suggest cerebral atrophy with increase in cerebral
size resulting in a condition referring to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).
Interestingly patients never tell about these symptoms, however when asked they
will answer in affirmation. Hence, it is very important to enquire about these three
symptoms whenever any patient above sixty years presents with any neurological
symptoms.
43
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Investigations
1.
MRI Brain - It would pick up small ischemic areas and other degenerative
neurological conditions if present.
2.
CT scan Brain
3.
Serum B12, folate, TSH , CBC and electrolytes
Chronic Memory Loss:
1. Senile dementia:
This is a clinical diagnosis and is made after excluding normal pressure hydrocephalus
which may coexist. The most important symptom in these patients is loss of recent
memory.
Treatment:
Donepezil – is available in 5 mg / 10 mg given TDS. Patients report an instant
improvement within 48 hrs of starting the medication. Should be taken for 6 wks and
may be continued for longer depending on the response. There are no major side
effects, though it is important to follow up once every 15 days while on Donepezil.
2. Normal pressure hydrocephalus: (Refer Fig. 3.1)
Clinical diagnosis is by presence of triad of loss of recent memory, urinary incontinence
and ataxia. It coexists with dementia and is confirmed by a CT scan or an MRI scan.
Treatment
This condition is correctable by surgery. The operation done is Ventriculo–peritoneal
(VP) shunt.
3. Multiple lacunar infarcts/ Vascular dementia : (Refer Fig. 3.2)
These patients have multiple small infarcts, none of which are big enough to cause
neurological defects. However there is cerebral atrophy.
Treatment:
Treatment is similar to cerebral ischemia.
1.
Aspirin
2.
Clopidogrel
3.
Pentoxyphyline
4.
Neuroprotective drugs – Piracetum, Citicholine
5.
Memory enhancers – Donepezil
6.
Supportive therapy – Neuroprotective vitamins (folic acid,
methylcobalamine, Biotin)
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
44
Practical management:-In the authors experience the best combination of drugs for
the above are Donepezil 10 mg -TDS + Citicholine – 1 BD + neuroprotective vitiamins
Referral:
Patient with senile dementia can be managed by the family physician and need not
be referred, however if the CT /MRI shows NPH then refer to a neurosurgeon.
Patients with vascular infarcts should be referred to a neurophysician.
Memory clinics:
In the last 1-2 yrs many memory clinics have come up in the metros.
4. Alzheimer’s: (Refer Fig. 3.3)
It is characterized by progressive deterioration of higher mental functioning with
impaired short term and long term memory, impaired judgement and abstract thinking,
personality changes, sleep disturbances, mood disturbances and affected speech. The
rate of progression may be variable.
Management
1) Basic principle
i.
Ensure that dehydration, infections, metabolic disturbances, pain are treated
effectively.
ii.
Correct hearing or visual loss
iii.
Avoid anticholinergic agents
iv.
Reduce the psychoactive medications with possible cognitive side effects to the
fewest at the lowest effective doses.
A) Pharmacologic therapy
i.
Degenerative dementia
Fig. 3.1
Fig. 3.2
Fig. 3.3
45
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Vitamin E are to be used
ii.
Other alternative medications like Ginkgo biloba, Hydergine are also been used
nowadays.
iii.
For behavioral symptoms like depression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
is to be used.
iv.
For anxiety, bupropion to be used
v.
For delusion, hallucinations, agitation medicines like donepezil, rivastigmine,
tacrine, respiridone, carbamazepine, valproic acid are to be prescribed.
3) Non Pharmacologic therapy
i.
Many of irreversible dementia needs multidisciplinary team which includes:
A neurologist, psychologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech
therapist
ii.
A physician should take charge in treating dementia patients and should
coordinate with other doctors of the team with regular follow ups.
iii.
Psychological therapy- Behavior modification technique
iv.
Rehabilitation: Research has shown that physical activity has slowed down the
progression of cognitive defects. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are
few of the helpful therapies.
v.
Environment changes : Modify the response, modify tasks
vi.
Care for the caregivers : Counseling of the caretaker is very important as it is
stressful to handle dementia patients. Psychologists can give tips to the care
givers about handling the patient.
Pharmacology & supplements

Below are the screening questions to differentiate various types of dementia:
1)
Onset - sudden or gradual
2)
Progression - rapid or slow
3)
Severity - mild, moderate or severe
4)
Any associated symptoms
a)
Focal neurological deficit
b)
Infections - any history of fever, weight loss, gait impairment
Depending upon the associated symptoms, causes differ
1)
In the presence of atypical course such as rapidly progressive, waxing &waning,
or series of abrupt changes in clinical course, consider causes like vascular,
infectious, inflammatory/autoimmune, toxic/metabolic processes, multiple
sclerosis, Dementia with Lewy bodies, Frontotemporal dementia, vascular
dementia, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.
2)
If there is presence of systemic symptoms such as headache, fever, dry eyes/
mouth, arthralgia, weight loss, or skin lesions then consider infectious,
inflammatory/autoimmune, neoplastic, paraneoplastic processes.
3)
If there is presence of sleep disorder, such as excessive day time sleepiness, loud
snoring, restlessness, insomnia, leg jerks while sleeping then the patient may
have obstructive sleep apnoea, central sleep apnoea, restless leg syndrome,
periodic limb movement disorder.
4)
Presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as behavior or personality change,
apathy, visual hallucinations, delusions, agitation may be due to toxic or metabolic
processes, infectious or inflammatory conditions or DLB, FTD
5)
If there is presence of neurological symtoms or signs like diplopia, dysphagia,
face &limb weakness or numbness, gait unsteadiness, then consider brain tumor
or abscess.
6)
In the presence of Parkinson’s signs such as masked facies, abnormal gait, stooped
posture, tremors, ridigity, suspect Parkinson’s disease, DLB, NPH.
Examination
1)
Check blood pressure, heart rate
2)
Check for any signs of trauma (head injury)
3)
Also look for nuchal rigidity, papilledema, focal facial or limb weakness, abnormal
deep tendon reflexes, Parkinsonism, gait impairment, fasciculations.
4)
Mini mental status examination
Treatment
Treat the underlying cause.

Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
SUMMARY
Memory problems are very common in elderly population. Normal aging
beyond 65 years may be associated with memory loss called senile
dementia. It is very important to differentiate abnormal memory loss,
for eg. Alzheimer's dementia, etc. from normal aging as the prognosis
will differ. Early identification and treatment can help to preserve and
slow down the progression of dementia. Lifestyle modifications,
environmental modifications and rehabilitative techniques play a key role
in the management of dementia. MRI and PET scan are used as diagnostic
and monitoring tools. Anticholinesterase drugs (donepezil),
neuroprotective agents are used for pharmacotherapy.
In patients with acute memory loss, underlying causes need to be
identified, investigated and treated appropriately and immediately.

4. Convulsions
These are the involuntary movements associated with loss of consciousness. They
may exist by themselves or present as an underlying neurological disorder.
There are three phases of a seizure:
Aura – This is the unusual sensation of a start of a seizure. The person will remain
conscious but experience unusual feelings or sensations. The person may experience
sudden and unexplainable feelings of joy, anger, sadness, or nausea. He or she also
may hear, smell, taste, see, or feel things that are not real.
Ictus – Meaning the attack.
Postictal – Meaning after the attack and postictal refers to the after effects of the
seizure like loss of consciousness.
Causes of convulsions:
•
Brain malformations or metabolic disorders.
•
Lack of oxygen (hypoxic brain injury) or intracranial haemorrhage during birth.
•
Low levels of blood sugar, blood calcium, blood magnesium or other electrolyte
disturbances.
•
Fever
•
Congenital conditions (Down’s syndrome; Angelman’s syndrome; tuberous
sclerosis and neurofibromatosis) and other genetic factors
•
Head trauma
•
Alcohol or drugs
•
Brain tumours- Supratentorialtumours
•
Drug withdrawal
•
Medications, Maternal use of drugs.

Referal:
Should be made to a neurophysician or a pediatrician incase of children.
Treatment:
1.
Treat the seizure episode with anticonvulsant as given below according to the
type.
2.
Treat the underlying cause with medications for medical conditions and surgery
for operable cases.
3.
Monitor and follow up regularly for repeat episodes. Ask the patient to maintain
record of seizure episode e.g. frequency of seizures, severity of seizures,
precipitating factors, etc. Adjust the current dose or add another anticonvulsant
if not under control.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
52
Types
A.
Febrile:
Most commonly seen in children of 6 months – 6 years age group. It presents as
generalized convulsions with febrile episodes. Sometimes also seen with
administration of vaccines.
Treatment:
Single episode no treatment required. Repeated episodes with EEG changes
anticonvulsants should be started as advised by the pediatrician. Valparin,
Gardinal, Levitiracetam.
B.
Generalized Tonic – ClonicSeziures:
Most commonly seen in adults and are associated with loss of consciousness.
There is sustained contraction followed by rhythmic contractions of all four
extremities. Tonic clonic movements (stiffening of limb along with jerking
movements) last for a few seconds to a few minutes. They invariably have post
convulsive period of drowsiness or stupor, lasting from a few minutes to a few
hours.
Treatment:
1.
Anti convulsants – any of the following
a.
Phenytoin
b.
Levitiracetam
c.
Sodium valproate
d.
Phenobarbitone (Gardinal)
e.
Carbamezapine
f.
Clonazepam
C.
Absence Seizure:
These consist of a brief lapse of awareness, it may occur in children as well as
adults. These are divided into simple absence seizure (there is no limb
involvement and post icteric phase) and complex absence seizure (loss of muscle
tone).
Treatment:
Not all anticonvulsants are effective in this type of seizures e.g. Carbamazepine
is ineffective, whereas Phenytoin and Gardinal are not very effective.
Drugs used are: Sodium valproate, Ethosuximide, Lamotrigine, Acetazolamide,
Clonazepam
53
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
D.
Partial Seizure:
There are of two types of partial seizures: simple partial (associated with psychic
phenomena known as Déjà vu, sense of unreality) which results in focal motor
movements without loss of consciousness. Complex partial, there is alteration in
consciousness, bizarre sensations such as dream like state, automatism or olfactory
sensations. Partial seizures occur due to focal brain lesions such as tumors,
infections, head injury and vascular malformations.
Treatment:
Any one of the following anticonvulsants can be given
1.
Phenobarbitone
2.
Phenytoin
3.
Levitiracetam
4.
Carbamazepine
5.
Oxcarbazepine
6.
Clonazepam
If not responding to the above then the following should be given
1.
Topiramate
2.
Lamotrigine
Surgery if unresponsive to above treatment
E.
Myoclonic Seizures:
These are characterised by repetitive jerking of large muscle groups. They are
clonic movements often confined to one limb, but may sometime involve the
axial musculature. They occur due to diffuse cerebral condition such as infections,
metabolic disorders such as uremia.
Treatment:
1.
Sodium Valproate
2.
Levitiracetam
3.
Benzodiazepines (Diazepam)
4.
Topiramate
5.
Lamotrigine
Surgery if unresponsive to above treatment
a)
Removal of seizure focus
b)
Temporal lobectomy
c)

5. Paralysis
Paralysis is the complete loss of muscle function for one or more muscle groups. It
can be associated with sensory loss along with the motor loss. It can occur on one or
both sides of the body. Paraplegia is the paralysis of lower half of the body whereas
paralysis of all four limbs is called quadriplegia. Hemiplegia (sometimes called
hemiparesis) is a condition that affects one side of the body.
What are the types?
Localised or generalized paralysis
Localized paralysis affect only a part of the body like facial paralysis – which is
usually limited to one side of the face or paralysis of the hand.
Generalized paralysis affects a wider area like monoplegia – where one limb is
paralysed; hemiplegia – where the arm and leg on one side of the body are paralysed;
paraplegia – where both legs, or sometimes the pelvis and some of the lower body
are paralyzed; quadriplegia where both the arms and legs are paralysed
Fig. 5.1
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
58
Temporary and permanent paralysis
Paralysis can either be temporary or permanent. Bell’s palsy is a relatively common
type of temporary paralysis. Sometimes paralysis that occurs after a stroke can also
be temporary.
Paralysis caused by serious injury, such as a complete spinal cord section, is usually
permanent.
Partial or complete paralysis
Paralysis can be partial – where there is some muscle function and sensation; for
example, if a person can move one leg but not the other, or feel sensations such as
cold and heat.
It can be complete – where there is complete loss of muscle function and sensation in
affected limbs.
Spastic or flaccid paralysis
Paralysis can be spastic – where muscles in affected limbs are unusually stiff or display
spasms, and movements are not under the control of the individuals.
In flaccid paralysis, muscles in affected limbs are floppy and weak. Patients with
flaccid paralysis often experience muscle weakness without spasms.
In some conditions, such as motor neuron disease or cerebral palsy, it is possible to
experience episodes of spastic paralysis followed by flaccid paralysis, or the other
way around.
Depending on the levels of spinal cord injury
Spinal cord injury between C1 and C7 is likely to result in quadriplegia.
The extent of the paralysis and subsequent loss of muscle function will depend on
level of  injury-C1 to C4 spinal cord injury will result in little or no movement in
limbs and patient will also need a ventilator to assist breathing. C7 spinal cord injury
patients will be able to extend their elbows and may have some movement in their
fingers.
T2 to T12 spinal cord injury will result in little or no function in lower limbs.
L1 to L5 injury may result in limited movement in the lower limbs.
The most common types of paralysis are-
Stroke where the blood supply to the brain is suddenly stopped or there is
haemorrhage in the surrounding brain tissue.
Spinal Cord Injury can cause damage to the nerves within the spinal canal due to
mostly trauma to the vertebral column, affecting sensory, motor and autonomic
function below the level of injury.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALS, also called Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a progressive
neurological disease where the progressive degeneration of the motor neurons
eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain
to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. Patients in the later stages of the
disease may become totally paralyzed.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians

Poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) has been eradicated from almost every country in
the world since the vaccines have been used. Paralytic polio occurs due to destruction
of motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex.
Spina Bifida is a type of neural tube defect leading to incomplete closure in the
spinal column.
Multiple Sclerosis is a disorder of the brain and spinal cord involving decreased
nerve function associated with scar formation on the covering of neurons.
Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks
part of the peripheral nervous system.
Cerebral Palsy is a group of conditions that affect control of movement and posture.
Brachial plexus injury can be due to excessive stretching, tearing, or other trauma to
a network of nerves from the spine to the shoulder, arm, and hand.
Muscular Dystrophy is a type of genetic diseases characterized by progressive
weakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement.
Syringomyelia/Tethered cord can include progressive deterioration of the spinal cord,
progressive loss of sensation or strength, profuse sweating, spasticity, pain and
autonomic dysreflexia.
Transverse Myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation across one
segment of the spinal cord.
The most common paralysis one is likely see in a practice are-
Bell’s palsy:
Localized paralysis occurs in Bell’s palsy where one side of the face may be paralysed
due to inflammation of the facial nerve i.e. the seventh cranial nerve, on that side.
Patients present with following complaints:
1.
Muscle weakness or paralysis
2.
Forehead wrinkles disappear
3.
Overall droopy appearance
4.
Impossible or difficult to blink

Investigations:
After taking a history and carefully observing the symptoms, tests that may be ordered
include various blood tests, MRI, or CT scan. These tests will either add conviction
to a diagnosis of Bell’s palsy, or provide the information needed to proceed in another
direction.
Treatment:
1.
Steroids (prednisone 80 mg once a day for three days, then 60 mg once a day for
three days, then 40 mg once a day for three days, then 20 mg once a day for
three days, then discontinue use.
2.
Analgesics
3.
Combination of steroids with antivirals
4.
Vitamin B complex
5.
Eye care
6.
Surgery (decompression of the seventh nerve)
7.
Physiotherapy
Referal:
Refer to a neurophysician or an ENT surgeon.
Stroke (cerebro vascular accidents):
Brain strokes either present as Transcient ischemic attack(TIA) or as full blown cerebro
vascular accidents (CVA) causing   hemiplegia (weakness on one side of the body)
.Most paralyses caused by nervous system damage are permanent in nature. The
paralysis of TIA is reversible whereas those of a CVA are irreversible. It is very
important to remember that most CVAs are preceded by TIA. If these TIA are
correctly diagnosed, investigated and treated, a full blown brain stroke can be easily
prevented.
Since majority of patients present initially to their family physician, it is very important
to be aware of this condition and treat it promptly. The role of the family physicians
in the prevention of CVA is therefore vital and crucial.
Common causes for brain stroke and TIA that should be kept in mind by the physician
are –
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
62
A – Anxiety
B – Body build
C – Cigarette Smoking
D – Diabetes/ Diet
E – Exercise lack
F – Family History
G – Gout
H – Hypertension
TIA’s: Patients present with one sided loss of sensations with limb weakness along
with blindness in one eye and difficulty in talking with giddiness. One, some or all of
these may be present. These last for a few minutes and then restore by themselves.
Investigations:
1.
CT scan or MRI of the brain with CT angiography or MR angiography
2.
Carotid Doppler with 2D Echo
3.
Lipid profile and diabetes screening.
Referal:
Urgent reference to a neurophysician or neurosurgeon.
Treatment:
1.
Identification and control of risk factors:
a.
Control of hypertension with anti hypertensives
b.
Intake of tobacco and smoking should be stopped.
c.
Reduction of anxiety with help of meditation or counseling.
d.
Weight reduction
e.
Diet regulation or moderation.
f.
Diabetic control if present.
The patient should be made aware to take care of the following –
A – Anxiety
B – Body build
C – Cigarette Smoking
D – Diabetes/ Diet
E – Exercise lack
F – Family History
G – Gout
63
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
H – Hypertension
2.
Identify if ischemia or hemorrhage with CT scan or MRI
3.
In case of ischemia – Aspirin and clopidogrel should be started, along with
neuroprotective drugs – Piracetam or citicholine, Methylcobalamin, Pyridoxine,
Folic acid combinations.
4.
Identification of the cause of ischemia- can be due to stenosis or occlusion of
large vessels such as carotid artery or smaller vessels such as branches of middle
and anterior cerebral artery.
Carotid stenosis:
If the stenosis is less than 50% then patient is treated medically. If 50% to 70% then
stenting is required. For stenosis of more than 70% surgical removal of the atheroma
is needed. The diagnosis of carotid stenosis can be made with a carotid Doppler
study.
Small vessel ischemia:
These are mostly treated medically. However in a few selected cases stenting or the
surgery of STA-MCA bypass are treatment options.
What is the management of chronic paralysis?
Bladder and bowel management:
Almost all types of spinal cord injury result in the loss of normal bowel and bladder
function.
There are many methods that can be used to manage a paralysed bladder. It is
important to ensure the bladder is emptied regularly because an overly full bladder
can trigger a serious complication called autonomic dysreflexia in high spinal cord
injuries.
There are two main types of catheter. They are:
•
Intermittent catheter – the catheter is temporarily inserted into the bladder and
removed once the bladder is empty. This leads to lesser complications then
indwelling catheter.
•
Indwelling catheter - remains in place for many days or weeks and is held in
position by a water-filled balloon in the bladder like the Foleys catheter, silicon
catheter. Indwelling catheters can be complicated by problems such as bladder
spasm, infection, blockage and leakage around the catheter, urinary stones, etc.
There are options to help people with paralysis empty their bowel:
•
Bowel retraining – The aim is to improve the consistency of stools and establish
a regular time to empty bowel. Medications such as dulcolax suppository can be
regularly used.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
64
•
Enemas – liquid is injected into bowel to help stimulate it to empty.
Referral:
An Urologist should be referred.
Neuropathic pain:
Neuropathic pain is pain caused by nerve damage. Neuropathic painrequires alternative
medications such as amitriptyline or pregabalin, a gaba analogue as it does not usually
respond to ordinary painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.
Breathing difficulties:
Breathing assistance from a ventilator maybe required if the diaphragm is paralysed.
A positive pressure ventilator can either be invasive –tracheostomy or non-invasive
– bi-Pap or C-Pap
Swallowing difficulty:
Dietary advice would be helpful from a dietician, who can guide about consistency
and type of food for a particular problem. Ryle’s tube may be required for some
patients with no gag reflexes. PEG tube is a long term option.
Spasticity and muscle spasms
Spasticity is a medical term that means abnormally stiff and rigid muscles. Many
people with paralysis develop spasticity and involuntary muscle spasms (where
muscles cramp and contract).
Treatment:
Muscle relaxants such as baclofen, tizanidine or dantrolene. If muscle relaxants are
not effective, an injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) may be given for localised spasms.
The effects of the injection usually last for up to three months.
Intrathecal baclofen therapy: surgically implanting a small pump on the outside of
the body connected to the spinal cord delivers regular doses of baclofen directly to
the spine.
Bed sore management:
Prevention: Special foam mattress or air mattress may be required for bed ridden
patients. Keep the skin dry by applying powder. Turn the patient on sides every two
hourly. Keep the perennial area clean and dry after urine or motion.
Treatment:
Daily dressing with betadine. Dermatology referral. Medication- calendula, permin
gel, multivitamin and good nutrition will help in healing of bed sore.

6. Neuropathic Pain
Neuropathic pain generally results from damage to nerves or impairment in the central
nervous system. It is diagnosed when pain is out of proportion to the injury. Pain
generally presents itself in the form of burning or tingling.
Causes
Most common causes of neuropathic pain seen in practice are diabetes,herpes zoster
(shingles),alcoholism, B 12 deficiency,trauma (nerve damage or spinal cord injury)
,degenerative disc disease(spondylosis).
Fig.6.1
Other causes are trigeminal neuralgia,multiple sclerosis, HIV or AIDS,post
chemotherapy and due to toxins.
It can also present itself after surgeries such as mastectomy or amputation (phantom
limb).Phantom limb syndrome is a condition which occurs when patient still feels the
pain from the missing limb as the nerve ending misfire and send abnormal signal to
the brain.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
66
Fig.6.2
Pressure on nerves due to malignancy can also cause neuropathic pain.
Pain in movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and dystonia, pain secondary
to spasticity, pain in frozen shoulder secondary to stroke are all categorized as
neuropathic pain.
Signs & Symptoms
Burning or shooting or piercingpain is typical of neuropathic pain, but in some cases
it may also be deep and aching.The pain may be radiating along the damaged
nerve.Tingling & numbness may be associated with the pain.
Increased sensitivity to touch and not alleviated by any of the normal pain killers.
The pain is long-lasting, typically persisting after the cause has been removed.The
pain is usually in the area of innervation of the damaged nerve, but the surrounding
areas may also be involved.
Investigation
Neuropathic pain is diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. Blood sugar &B 12 level
may be checked.Look for compression of nerve, rash (herpes zoster).
67
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Treatment
For treatment antidepressants and anticonvulsants are most commonly used as regular
analgesics do not work.
Diabetic neuropathy
Pregabalin75 mg bid & may increase to 150 mg bid & then maximum upto 300mg bid
Or
Gabapentin 300mg on day 1, 300mg bid on day 2, 300 mg tds on day 3, & continue
300 tds for 1 week .If the pain is not getting controlled the dose can be increased upto
600 mg tds gradually.
Post herpetic neuralgia
Antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Tryptomer) 25-75mg per day is recommended.
Trigeminal neuralgia
Carbamazepine (Tegretol) start 100mg bid & can increase by 100mg each dose to a
maximum of 400mg bid  in case of neuralgiacaused by pressure.
Post-surgical patients -Tramadol 50mg bid/tds then can increase to 100 bid/tds
maximum upto 200mg  bid.
Localised pain
Local application of anaesthetic like xylocainegel or patch.
Surgical option may be required in non responding cases or severe cases.
Botox intradermal injections in case of focal pain can be used and is effective for
around 14 weeks.
Surgery:
Epidural implantation of electrode in the spine for chronic leg pains has been
tried.Intrathecal pumps have also been tried in some patients.Nerve ablation procedure
in severe cases can be done.
Rehabilitation
Mobilization and physiotherapy are important to prevent disuse atrophy. Patient
must be protected from depression and appropriate counseling should be provided.
Referal-pain management specialist, neurophysician or neurosurgeon.

7.  Physical Disabilities in Children
A physical disability is any condition that permanently prevents normal body
movement and/or control. There are many different types of physical disabilities.
Below are some questions to be asked when a child suffering from any kind of physical
impairment or disability is brought to you:
1.
Ask whether the illness or condition causing physical dysfunction is congenital
(present since birth) or acquired.
2.
Ask about the course of illness and disability - the onset, duration and progression;
whether the disability, for e.g. weakness, is progressive or non progressive.
3.
Ask whether the child has any associated intellectual impairment (delays in oral
language development, self-help or self-care skills, developing social skills, deficits
in memory and problem solving skills, etc), visual or hearing problems
4.
Ask whether there is any delay in overall development of the child (delayed
sitting, crawling, walking, speaking, interacting with parents, etc compared to
normal typically developing child)
5.
Ask the parents about a detailed birth history of the child, which includes -
Prenatal history (mother suffered from infection, hypertension during pregnancy,
on medications other than pregnancy related medicines, etc); Perinatal history
(whether the baby was full term or pre term, delivery was normal or assisted -
Caesarean section or took too long, whether the baby cried immediately after
birth or not); Postnatal history (whether the baby suffered from fever, jaundice,
etc)
Causes of physical disabilities
There are many different causes for physical disabilities. These include:
1.
Perinatal hypoxia: Injury to the brain due to problems during gestation (prenatal),
during childbirth (natal) or after birth (postnatal)
2.
Serious infections affecting the brain, nerves or muscles, such as poliomyelitis
3.
Inherited or genetic disorders, such as muscular dystrophy, leucodystrophy,
glycogen storage disorders, etc.
69
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
4.
Conditions present at birth (congenital birth defects), such as spina bifida,
meninmgomyelocoele, etc.
5.
Trauma: spinal cord injury and head injury
Some of the main ones include:
Cerebral palsy
Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the parts of the brain which control movement
during the early stages of development. In most cases, this damage occurs during
pregnancy. However, damage can sometimes occur during birth and from brain injuries
in early infancy (such as lack of oxygen from near drowning, meningitis, head injury
or being shaken).
Children with cerebral palsy may have:
•
delayed development
•
abnormal posture (the ability to put the body in a chosen position and keep it
there)
•
difficulty in movement of body parts or the whole body
•
muscle weakness or tightness
•
involuntary muscle movements (spasms)
•
imbalance and incoordination
•
difficulty talking and eating.
Children can have different types of cerebral palsy:
•
Hemiplegic (involves muscle movements and weakness
on one side of the body)
•
Diplegic (involves muscle movements and weakness in
the lower part of the body)
•
Quadriplegic (involves muscle movements and
weakness in both arms and both legs)
•
Ataxic (involves problems with balance and
coordination).
•
Dystonic/choreoathetoid (involuntary movements of
hands ,legs and head /neck/ face)
Poliomyelitis
Poliomyelitis is an infectious disease caused by polio virus. A very few cases of
poliomyelitis develop a paralytic poliomyelitis. Paralytic poliomyelitis may be clinically
suspected in children experiencing a) acute onset of flaccid paralysis in one or more
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
70
limbs with b) decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot
be attributed to another apparent cause, and c) without sensory or cognitive loss.
Minor symptoms such as fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, neck stiffness and pain
in the arms and legs may be present and last for few days. There are many causes of
acute flaccid paralysis (AFP); polio virus infection is one of the main causes. Acute
poliomyelitis affects the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord and brain
stem causing severe muscle pain and spasms, followed by flaccid asymmetric weakness
and muscle atrophy. Paralysis is usually asymmetric, begins in proximal extremities,
and progresses to distal muscle groups. Paralysis remains for days or weeks before
slow recovery occurs over months or years. Physical activity and intramuscular
injections during the acute paralysis period should be avoided since they are known
to cause exacerbation of the symptoms. There is no cure for poliomyelitis, however,
it can be prevented by regular immunization through vaccination as per schedule.
Therefore, family practitioner plays a very important role in prevention of polio.
One should emphasize compliance to vaccination schedule.
71
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Congenital defects
Spina bifida
Sometimes, a baby's spinal cord does not develop normally during pregnancy. When
this happens, the child can have a physical disability called spina bifida. The type and
amount of disability caused by spina bifida will depend upon the level of the
abnormality of the spinal cord. Children with spina bifida may have:
•
partial or full paralysis of the legs
•
difficulties with bowel and bladder control.
They may also have:
•
hydrocephalus (high pressure on the brain because of fluid not being drained
away normally
•
bone and joint deformities (they may not grow normally)
•
curvature (bending) of the spine.
Muscular dystrophies
When a child has muscular dystrophy, the muscles show progressive weakness. The
child may have difficulty running, walking, getting up from the floor, etc. Children
can have different types of muscular dystrophy. The most common type is Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy which occurs only in boys. All types of muscular dystrophy are
genetic even though other family members may not have the condition.
Multiple disabilities
Some children with physical disabilities will have other disabilities, such as intellectual,
visual or hearing impairments. They may also have communication difficulties or
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
72
other medical conditions such as epilepsy or asthma. When a child has several different
types of disability, professionals talk about multiple disabilities rather than listing
separate conditions.
Acquired brain and spinal injuries
Physical disabilities may result from permanent injuries to the brain, spinal cord or
limbs that prevent proper movement in parts of the body.
Investigations to be considered:
1.
CT scan: A CT scan of the brain or spinal cord could be ordered as a screening
tool to identify the underlying CNS pathology.
2.
MRI scan: An MRI brain or spinal cord could be ordered in highly suspected
cases of CNS disorders (encephalitis, epilepsy, etc). It is also helpful in detecting
congenital malformations of the brain and spinal cord (meningomyelocele, spina
bifida, etc)
3.
Blood tests: Various blood tests to identify metabolic disorders (phenylketonuria,
juvenile diabetes, etc), electrolyte imbalance and vitamin deficiencies
(hypokalemia, Vit B12 deficiency, etc), hormonal disorders (hypothyroidism),
etc could be ordered.
4.
EEG: An EEG is ordered to identify any coexisting epileptic foci in the brain.
73
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
8. Intellectual Disability in
Children
Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by below-average intelligence or mental
ability and a lack of skills necessary for day-to-day living. People with intellectual
disabilities can and do learn new skills, but they learn them more slowly. The degrees
of intellectual disability vary, from mild to profound.
Mental retardation is used as a blanket term for all patients with intellectual disabilities.
However, this is not appropriate as all the children with IDs do not have low IQ.
Therefore, we as doctors need to distinguish between MR and MR like conditions.
We need to be sensitive and careful before labeling a child with MR as it may be very
daunting for the parents and may affect the future of the child.
Intellectual disability can be divided into a) Mental retardation, b) Autism spectrum
disorders and c) Learning disability
a)
Mental retardation: In cases of mental retardation, intelligence level as
determined by individual standard assessment is below 70, and the ability to
adapt to the demands of normal life is impaired. Behavioral traits associated
with MR may include aggression, dependency, impulsivity, passivity, self-injury,
stubbornness, low self-esteem, and low frustration tolerance.
b)
Autism spectrum disorders: Autistic children do not generally have diminished
cognitive functioning. They have normal, even above normal intelligence. The
issue with autistic children is their inability to function socially within the social
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
74
environment. They are unable to communicate with the outside world, using
language. The classical triad of ASD shows: deficits in socialization, language
and communication, stereotypical repetitive behavior.
c)
Learning disability: A child who has learning disability may have difficulty
reading, writing, spelling, reasoning, recalling and/or organizing information
if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways.
Common types of learning disabilities include: Dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia,
language processing disorders, deficits in auditory processing, visual perceptual/
motor deficit, memory deficits, etc. A child suffering from ADHD may also
present with LD. Children with learning disabilities are of average or above
average intelligence. LDs should not be confused with learning problems which
may be due to visual, hearing, or motor handicaps; mental retardation; emotional
disturbance; and or environmental, cultural or economic disadvantages.
Someone with intellectual disability has limitations in two areas. These areas are:
•
Intellectual functioning. Also known as IQ, this refers to a person's ability to
learn, reason, make decisions, and solve problems.
•
Adaptive behaviors. These are skills necessary for day-to-day life, such as being
able to communicate effectively, interact with others, and take care of oneself.
IQ (intelligence quotient) is measured by an IQ test. The average IQ is 100. A person
is considered intellectually disabled if he or she has an IQ of less than 70 to 75.
A child's adaptive behavior is analyzed by observing the child's skills and comparing
them to other children of the same age. Things that may be observed include how
well the child can feed or dress himself or herself; how well the child is able to
communicate with and understand others; and how the child interacts with family,
75
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
friends, and other children of the same age.
Signs of intellectual disability in children
•
Impaired comprehension or understanding
•
Slow learning
•
Delayed developmental milestones
•
Delayed speech and language, and communication deficits
•
Slow memory
•
Abnormal behavior
•
Affected ADLs
•
Affected logical reasoning and problem solving ability
In children with severe or profound intellectual disability, there may be other health
problems as well. These problems may include seizures, mental disorders, motor
handicaps, vision problems, or hearing problems.
Causes:
ID could be a result of abnormal brain development or brain injury after birth or
during childhood.
The most common causes of intellectual disability are:
•
Genetic conditions: These include things like Down syndrome and fragile
X syndrome.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
76
•
Problems during pregnancy: Things that can interfere with fetal brain
development include alcohol or drug use, malnutrition, certain infections, or
preeclampsia.
•
Problems during childbirth: Intellectual disability may result if a baby is deprived
of oxygen during childbirth or born extremely premature.
•
Illness or injury: Infections like meningitis, whooping cough, or measles can
lead to intellectual disability. Severe head injury, near-drowning, extreme
malnutrition, exposure to toxic substances such as lead, and severe neglect or
abuse can also be a cause.
Prevention:
Certain causes of intellectual disability are preventable. Nutritional causes and
problems during birth are the most common causes in India. Getting proper prenatal
care, taking a prenatal vitamin, and getting vaccinated against certain infectious
diseases can also lower the risk that your child will be born with intellectual disabilities.
In families with a history of genetic disorders, genetic testing may be recommended
before conception.
Certain tests, such as ultrasound and amniocentesis, can also be performed during
pregnancy to look for problems associated with intellectual disability. Although these
tests may identify problems before birth, they cannot correct them.
Diagnosis:
Intellectual disability may be suspected for many different reasons with a series of
supportive investigations such as:
1.
CT scan: A CT scan may help in identifying any structural abnormality or damage
to the brain.
2.
MRI scan: An MRI may help in diagnosing the disorder by helping visualize
tissues of the brain and their integrity.
3.
Blood tests: Blood tests may help identify metabolic disorders and nutritional
deficits causing impaired mental function.
4.
EEG: An EEG may help identify an underlying epileptic focus in the brain even
before the symptoms arise.
5.
Genetic testing: It is used to confirm the diagnosis by showing mutations in
various genes which may be hereditary or acquired during gestation.

9. Computed Tomography (CT)
Neurological CT scans are used to view the brain and spine. They can detect bone
and vascular irregularities, certain brain tumors and cysts, herniated discs, epilepsy,
encephalitis, spinal stenosis, a blood clot or intracranial bleeding in patients with
stroke, brain damage from head injury, and other disorders. It can also be used to
guide biopsies.
Computed tomography, also known as a CT scan, is a noninvasive, painless, X-ray
imaging procedure used to produce rapid, clear two-dimensional images of organs,
bones, and tissues. The cross-sectional images generated during a CT scan can be
reformatted in multiple planes, and can even generate three-dimensional images.
Depending on the clinical indication, the scan can be performed with or without
intravenous contrast injection.
When to order CT v/s MRI?
•
CT scan is used in emergency neurological conditions, as it is quick, takes lesser
time and easily available.
•
CT is very good for imaging bony structures. Therefore, in all head trauma
cases and accidents with multiple injuries, CT scan should be ordered as a
screening test.
•
CT scan can easily and quickly distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic
stroke. Thus, in all suspected stroke cases CT brain scan should be ordered
immediately.
•
In cases of severe headache or atypical headache or headache with warning
signs, CT brain scan should be ordered.
•
In any cases of altered mental status or coma, CT brain should be ordered.
•
CT scan is used as a screening tool for migraine, tumours, transient ischaemic
attacks (TIA), dizziness, seizures, congenital deformities of the skull or brain,
etc.
•
Patients having metallic implants, pacemakers cannot receive an MRI but can
have a CT scan.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
80
•
CT scan may be done as a pre-requisite for surgical procedures of the brain and
spinal cord (for e.g. CT guided biopsy).
Four basic steps of CT scanning:
1.
X-Ray Production
2.
Data Acquisition
3.
Data Processing
4.
Image Display
CT scan works much like other X-ray examinations in which different parts of the
part being scanned absorb X-rays in varying degrees. It is this crucial difference in
absorption that allows the body parts to be distinguished from one another on an X-
ray film or CT electronic image.
The CT scanner takes X-ray images at various angles around the body with the help
of rotating X-ray beams and X-ray detectors. These images are processed by a
computer to produce cross-sectional pictures of the body. These pictures are seen as
an X-ray ‘slice’ of the body, which is recorded on a film and called as a tomogram.
Three-dimensional models of the body area also can be created by stacking the slices
together.
Certain exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the person’s
body through intravenous injection, orally or per rectum. Contrast CT scan helps to
highlight structures such as blood vessels and obtain functional information about
specific tissues.
CT scanning is used in medicine as a diagnostic tool and as a guide for interventional
procedures.
Indications for head CT examination include the following:
•
Head trauma
•
Stroke
•
Headaches
•
Initial evaluation for space-occupying lesions, tumors
•
Unexplained change in mental status
•
Seizures
•
Suspected hydrocephalus
•
Suspected intracranial hematoma, infections
•
Psychiatric disorders
•
Dizziness
•
Vascular occlusive disease and aneurysm evaluation
•
Diseases or malformations of the skull
•
Guide the biopsy of the brain
81
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Indications for spine CT examination include the following:
•
Guide diagnostic procedures such as the biopsy of a suspicious area to detect
cancer, or the removal of fluid from a localized infection (abscess)
•
Congenital anomalies of the spine
•
Tumors of the spinal cord, spinal pain
•
Spinal injury
•
Detection of spinal canal stenosis, vertebral fracture, and infection of the
spine and spinal cord.
•
When MRI is not available/possible.
Special precautions to be taken for CT examination include the following:
•
CT should be performed for pregnant patients only in critical situations
and only after discussion of the potential risks and benefits.
•
Repeated X-ray exposure may increase the patient’s risk for cancer.
However, the risk from any one scan is small, with the benefit of an accurate
diagnosis outweighing the risks.
•
In certain clinical situations, intravenous contrast administration is indicated.
Contrast media is safe in most patients. However, adverse reactions may
occur in patients who have an allergy to the IV contrast media, or patients
suffering from renal impairment, hyperthyroidism, phaeochromocytoma,
myasthenia gravis, etc.
•
Checklist to be considered before ordering a CT scan with contrast:
a)
Presence of renal failure (as in alcohol abuse, angina, heart failure,
kidney problems, liver disease, severe infection).
b)
If taking diabetes medication Metformin, medicine may need to be
stopped temporarily for 48 hours (Since contrast medium affects the
kidneys temporarily and kidneys are involved in removal of metformin,
contrast medium can greatly increase the levels of metformin in the
blood which increases the risk of lactic acidosis.)
c)
Any previous reaction to contrast.
d)
It is recommended that nursing mothers should wait 24 hours after
contrast administration to resume breastfeeding.
Advantages of CT scan:
•
The time taken for total testing is shorter in CT than for MRI. Thus, CT is used
in emergency settings as well as a screening method for detecting suspected
brain and spine disorders, wherein use of MRI is not possible due o unavailability
and/or time constraints.
•
MRI cannot be done on patients who are claustrophobic as the patient has to
remain inside the noisy machine for about 20-45 minutes. CT is more comfortable.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
82
•
CT scan is cheaper than an MRI.
•
CT is less sensitive to patient motion than MRI.
Disadvantages of CT scan:
•
Risk of ionizing radiations is always there in CT scan.
•
CT does not differentiate well between bone, soft tissue and blood vessels. It
also does not give inter soft tissue differentiation.
•
Contrast medium used in CT contains iodine, while MRI uses non iodine contrast
medium.
•
CT scan does not visualize the spinal cord adequately.

10. Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI)
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses a powerful
magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of body structures
including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves to study the anatomy and physiology of
the body in both health and disease. An MRI differs from a CT scan, in that it does
not use radiation. Brain and spine MRI is an excellent diagnostic and prognostic tool
for various neurological and neuromuscular disorders like cerebrovascular diseases,
tumours, demyelinating and infectious diseases of the brain and spinal cord.
When to order an MRI scan instead of CT scan?
•
MRI is done once CT scan has already detected a brain tumour. MRI visualizes
the brain and soft tissues very well, so, the extent, spread, type and staging of
the tumour can be done in detail.
•
MRI is done as a follow up scan in cases of stroke to know the area of damage
and prognosis.
•
In cases of spinal cord injury, degenerative disc disease, spinal cord tumour,
meningioma, meningomyelocoele, transverse myelitis, infections of the spine,
MRI is done. Spinal cord is visualized better with MRI than with CT scan.
•
MRI is an imaging modality of choice in cases where a definitive diagnosis is
suspected clinically or through previous imaging like CT scan. It is used to confirm
the diagnosis and to better visualize the soft tissues and their abnormalities.
•
In neurodegenerative conditions, for e.g. dementia, multiple sclerosis, multi
system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease, cerebellar ataxia, etc, an MRI scan is
preferred.
•
MRI is ordered in cases of behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders.
Principle of MRI
The hydrogen protons contained in water molecules of the body exhibit tiny magnetic
fields which normally move around randomly. During an MRI scan, when short bursts
85
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
of radio waves are applied to the body, these tiny magnetic fields of the hydrogen
protons align to the magnetic field and realign back into place alternately. This makes
the protons' magnetic fields spin round in unison and emit a weak radio signal in
resonance. The protons in different tissues of the body realign at different speeds
and thus, emit signals of varying intensities. This forms the basis of differentiation of
various soft and hard tissues of the part being scanned. A receiving device receives
and transmits the resonance signals to a computer, where clear, cross-sectional black
and white images of the body are created. Each of these images shows a thin slice of
the body and differentiates between bone, soft tissues and fluid-filled spaces by
their water content and structural properties. These images can be converted into
three-dimensional (3-D) pictures of the scanned area. The field strength of the magnet
is measured in tesla, and the majority of systems operate at 1.5T. T1 image weighting
is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex and identifying fatty tissue, while T2 image
weighting is useful for detecting edema and revealing white matter lesions.
Contrast MRI scanning
Chelates of gadolinium are the most commonly used intravenous contrast agents.
•
These agents are safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray
radiography or CT.
•
Gadolinium agents are safe in patients with renal impairment, though precautions
have to be taken before administering these agents in specific cases.
•
In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis there is a risk of
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Therefore, dialysis patients should receive
gadolinium agents only when essential.
•
Dialysis should be performed as soon as possible after the scan to remove the
agent from the body promptly.
Indications of MRI brain
•
To check for causes of muscle weakness, numbness and tingling.
•
To check for causes of symptoms such as change in consciousness, confusion, or
abnormal movements. These symptoms may be caused by brain diseases, such
as Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's
disease.
•
To look for tumors, infections, abscess, or conditions of the brain or brain stem,
such as encephalitis or meningitis.
•
To investigate birth defects and developmental anomalies.
•
To investigate causes of epilepsy (seizure).
•
To check for integrity of brain and other cranial structures in head trauma.
•
To diagnose a stroke or blood vessel problems in the head.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
86
•
To investigate psychiatric disorders.
•
To look for causes of hearing loss, memory loss, headaches, speaking difficulties,
vision problems and dizziness.
•
To diagnose vascular occlusive disease and aneurysm.
Indications of MRI spine
•
To assess the spinal anatomy and alignment in injury and birth defects.
•
To look for causes of muscle weakness in the limbs, numbness and tingling,
abnormal movements.
•
To look for problems in controlling or emptying urinary bladder.
•
To assess intervertebral disc and joint for diagnosing sciatica, nerve root
entrapment, spinal cord indentation.
•
To assess compression of spinal cord and nerves.
•
To help plan and monitor spinal surgical procedures, such as decompression of
compressed spinal cord and nerves or spinal fusion.
•
To image spinal infection or tumors.
•
To assess inflammation of the spinal cord or nerves.
Contraindications of MRI scan
•
Patients with metal implants (brain aneurysm clips , prosthetic metal heart valves,
eye implants, intrauterine device, artificial joints, dental fillings and braces, tubal
ligation clips, surgical clips or staples) and  implanted electronic device (cardiac
defibrillator, pacemaker, retained leads, implanted nerve stimulators, implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator) can experience excess MRI related heating during the
scanning procedure.
•
These implants can also interfere with the MR signaling and produce artifacts
which deteriorate the quality of images and also may produce false and
misleading images of the inside of the scanned body part.
•
The patients need to inform about these implants to the referring doctor and
staff carrying out MRI scanning so that they are aware of the risks associated
with MRI scanning and measures are taken to ensure the scan is as safe as possible.
•
Some tattoo ink contains traces of metal, but most tattoos are safe in an MRI
scanner.
•
MRI scans are not usually recommended during pregnancy, particularly in the
first three months.
Advantages of MRI scan
•
MR images of the brain and other cranial structures are clearer and more detailed
87
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
than with other imaging methods. Thus, MRI should be preferred for imaging if
available.
•
MRI uses non iodine contrast medium which is safer than iodine containing
contrast media used in X-ray and CT imaging.
•
Risk of ionizing radiations is absent in MRI scan.
•
MRI is the most sensitive means to detect and evaluate brain tumors.
•
MRI can detect stroke at a very early stage (within less than 30 minutes) by
mapping the motion of water molecules in the tissue.
•
The MRI examination poses almost no risk to the average patient when
appropriate safety guidelines are followed.
Disadvantages of MRI scan
•
Implanted medical devices that contain metal may malfunction or cause problems
in obtaining clear images during an MRI exam.
•
Metallic implants, pacemakers may malfunction or cause problems during an
MRI exam.
•
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis may occur as a complication of MRI caused by
the injection of high doses of gadolinium-based contrast material in patients
with very poor kidney function.
•
A person who is very obese and large may not fit into the opening of certain
types of MRI machines.
•
The time taken for MRI scanning is longer than for CT.  Also, traction devices
and life support equipment used in emergency settings have to be kept away
from the area to be imaged. Thus, MRI cannot be used in emergency settings.
•
MRI is many a time uncomfortable for patients who are claustrophobic and cannot
remain in the noisy machine for such long testing time.
•
MRI costs more than CT.
•
MRI is sensitive to patient motion. Patient motion can give rise to bad quality
images.
MRI with DTI
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique used to noninvasively visualize
anatomical connections between different parts of the brain. It is used to study
abnormalities in white matter fiber structure (location and orientation) and brain
connectivity. DTI is useful in the investigation of stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis,
brain abscesses, brain tumors (localization, infiltration), mild traumatic brain injury
(defining the severity), and hypertensive encephalopathy. It is used in surgical planning
of brain tumors, to determine the proximity and relative position of the corticospinal
tracts and a tumor.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
88
DTI tractography is a 3D modeling technique used to visualize neural tracts. It can
also visualize very short connections present among cortical and subcortical regions.
It is used for measuring deficits in white matter (such as in aging), differentiation of
brain tumour, distinguishing between acute-ischemic changes and chronic-ischemic
changes in cases of stroke, diagnosing and follow up of MS lesions, determining the
location and extent of epileptic foci, etc. It helps in preoperative planning in terms of
determining the extent of diffuse infiltration of pathologic tissue (for e.g. tumour,
abscess) to minimize functional damage and residual tumor volume.

11. Angiography
Angiography is a very specialized test which is ordered by a neurologist or a
neurosurgeon. Angiography is a minimally invasive medical test that uses X-rays or
MRI technology and an iodine or gadolinium containing contrast material to produce
pictures of the blood vessels. Imaging of the vascular architecture of the brain is
termed as Neuro-angiogaphy.
Angiography can be performed using:
•
Digital X-ray technology (DSA)
•
Computed Tomography (CT)
•
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a type of fluoroscopy technique used to
clearly visualize blood vessels in a bony or dense soft tissue environment.
Procedure: A pre-contrast image which includes all the structures within the head
like skull, brain, CSF, meninges, blood vessels, etc. is acquired first by a digital X-ray
using technology. In catheter angiography a catheter is introduced into the superficial
femoral artery of the patient after giving local anaesthesia (general anaesthesia in
children) and navigated under X-ray guidance up to the carotid artery where an
iodine containing contrast material is injected and multiple X-ray images are taken.
In IV-DSA, radiopaque iodine based dye is injected intravenously into the body. The
contrast material flows along with the blood to the cerebral arteries and highlights
the blood vessels on the X-ray. These images are simultaneously stored in the computer
which then subtracts the 'pre-contrast image' from the 'post-contrast image'. Tissues
and blood vessels on the first image are digitally subtracted from the second image,
leaving a clear picture of the artery or vein for assessing the integrity of these blood
vessels and abnormalities in them.
CT angiography uses a CT scanner to produce detailed images of both blood vessels
of the brain. An iodine containing contrast is through intravenous route. A CT scan is
then performed while the contrast flows through the blood vessels to the blood
vessels of the brain. After scanning, the images are processed on a computer and
reviewed in different planes and projections. In Digital Subtraction Angiography
(DSA), images are electronically manipulated to remove (subtract) bones and other
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
90
structures obscuring the images taken to make the blood vessels stand out.
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
technology to image blood vessels.
Various MRI techniques include:
•
Flow-dependent angiography
–
Time-of-flight (TOF) or inflow angiography
–
Phase-contrast (PC-MRA)
•
Flow-independent angiography
–
Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography
–
Subtraction less Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography
–
Non-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography
Indications of cerebral angiography

discussion of benefits and risks.
•
Complications such as an allergic reaction to the anesthetic or the contrast medium,
blockage or damage to the vessel punctured, thrombosis and embolism formation,
bleeding or bruising at the site of puncture/injection, and anywhere along the
vessel during passage of the catheter, increased risk of ionizing radiation can
also occur.
MR Angiography:
•
Patients with metal implants and implanted electronic device (cardiac defibrillator,
pacemaker)
•
Pregnancy (especially in the first trimester)
Advantages of DSA
•
Results from cerebral angiography are more accurate than those produced by
carotid Doppler ultrasound or other noninvasive imaging of the blood vessels.
•
Use of a catheter makes it possible to combine diagnosis and treatment in a
single procedure.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
92
Disadvantages of DSA
•
Risk of ionizing radiations and allergic reaction to iodine containing contrast is
present.
•
Risk to the foetus in pregnant females.
•
Risk of catheter introduction causing damage to the vessels is present.
•
Risk of stroke occurring due to dislodged thrombus from artery into the vessels
supplying brain by the catheter is present.
Advantages of MR angiography
•
It is a non-invasive technique not involving introduction of catheter into any
blood vessel.
•
It does not use ionizing radiations.
•
Contrast medium used in MRA does not contain iodine and is less toxic and can
be used in patients with renal impairment.
Disadvantages of MR angiography:
•
It is unsafe and cannot be used for patients having metal and electronic implants.
•
High cost of MRA makes it a less frequently used diagnostic test.

12. Plain X-Ray
X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. When the body is exposed
to X-rays, different parts of the body absorb different amounts of radiation and
allow varying amounts of the X-rays to pass through depending on their densities.
X-rays pass through body tissues onto specially treated plates and a 'negative' type
picture is made. Images are produced in degrees of light and dark, depending on the
amount of X-rays that penetrate the tissues. The soft tissues in the body (such as
blood, skin, fat, and muscle) allow most of the X-ray to pass through and appear
dark gray on the film. A bone, metal or a tumor, which is denser than the soft tissues,
allows few of the X-rays to pass through and appears white on the X-ray. At a break
in a bone, the X-ray beam passes through the broken area and appears as a dark line
in the white bone.
Radiographs are useful in the detection of pathology of the skeletal system as well as
for detecting some disease processes in soft tissue of brain and spinal cord. Radiographs
may show fractures, presence of foreign body intracranial air, midline shift of
structures through shift of calcified pineal gland, etc.
For some types of X-ray tests, a contrast medium such as iodine or barium is introduced
into the patient's body, either orally, intravenously, rectally or intrathecally
(myelogram). In some people, the injection of a contrast medium can cause side effects
such as feeling of warmth or flushing, a metallic taste in the mouth, lightheadedness,
nausea, itching and rarely, severe reactions which include severe hypotension,
anaphylactic shock and cardiac arrest.
Though X-rays of the skull are not used as often as in the past, due to the use of
newer technologies such as computed tomography (CT scans) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), they remain valuable for evaluating the bones of the skull and spine
for fractures and detecting other conditions of the skull, spine and their contents.
Indications of X-ray imaging
•
Head trauma
•
Spine trauma
•
Suspected non-accidental injuries to detect previous injuries
95
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
To detect tumors
•
Congenital anomalies of the cranial vault and spine
•
Headache
•
Certain metabolic and endocrine disorders that cause bone defects of the
skull.
•
Detect cerebral calcification
•
Migration of the soft tissues inside the skull
Contraindications of X-ray imaging
•
Risks associated with radiation exposure may be related to the cumulative number
of X-ray examinations and/or treatments over a long period of time.
•
Radiation exposure during pregnancy may lead to birth defects. When taking a
skull X-ray, special precautions should be made to minimize the radiation
exposure to the foetus.
•
Patients having allergy to iodine or barium contrast agents are contraindicated
for contrast induced X-ray imaging.
•
Contrast media is safe in most patients. However, adverse reactions may range
from mild to severe in patients suffering from renal impairment,
hyperthyroidism, phaeochromocytoma, myasthenia gravis, etc

13. Positron Emission Tomography-
Computer Tomography (PET-CT)
Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a very specialized scanning procedure,
which is used only in specialized cases, where apart from structural imaging, a
functional imaging of the body part is required (for e.g. tumours, Alzheimer's disease,
epilepsy, behavioral disorders, etc.). PET is a functional imaging technique that
produces a three-dimensional image of functional processes in the body.
Procedure: A positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), usually fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG), an analogue of glucose is introduced into the body on a biologically active
molecule intravenously, which is taken up by active tissues of the body. Gamma rays
are created during the emission of positrons from these active tissues, and the scanner
then detects the gamma rays. A computer then analyzes the gamma rays and uses the
information to create an image map of the organ or tissue being studied.
Principle: PET neuroimaging is based on the principle that areas of high radioactivity
are associated with brain activity. The amount of the radionuclide collected in the
tissue affects how brightly the tissue appears on the image, and indicates the level of
organ or tissue function. If blood flow and perfusion of an organ or tissue has to be
studied, the radionuclide chosen may be a type of radioactive oxygen, carbon,
nitrogen, or gallium.
Functional imaging obtained by PET can be more precisely aligned or correlated
with anatomic imaging obtained by CT scanning. In modern PET-CT scanners, three
dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a CT X-ray scan performed
on the patient during the same session, in the same machine.
Uses of PET-CT scans
PET and PET-CT scans are performed to:
•
To detect suspected brain and spinal tumours.
•
To detect cancer metastasis and recurrence of tumors.
•
To determine staging of patients with tumours where staging is difficult
clinically, and also to help in radiotherapy planning.
97
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
To evaluate the prognosis of a treatment plan, such as cancer therapy.
•
To evaluate and diagnose memory disorders (Alzheimer's disease) and other
central nervous system disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's
disease, epilepsy, and cerebrovascular accident.
•
To localize epileptic foci.
•
To evaluate the perfusion (blood and oxygen flow) of the brain tissue using the
tracer oxygen-15.
•
To examine links between specific psychological processes or disorders and brain
activity.
•
To locate the specific surgical site prior to surgical procedures of the brain.
•
To facilitate PET-image guided surgery of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous
malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.
•
To map normal human brain for research purposes.
•
To compare the effects of a treatment intervention on brain function, using a pre
and post intervention PET scan.
Contraindications of PET-CT scan
•
Pregnant females should not undergo the scan since radiation is believed to be
unsafe for developing fetuses.
•
Recent chemotherapy or radiotherapy can make interpretation difficult.
•
Patients having allergies or who are sensitive to radionuclide, contrast dyes, or
iodine.
•
Very obese people may not fit into the opening of a PET-CT scanner.
Precautions for PET-CT scan
•
Other imaging methods should be considered for pregnant patients.
•
Patients who are claustrophobic may find the test uncomfortable.
•
High blood glucose levels in diabetics may interfere with the accuracy of a PET
scan, since high levels lower the FDG tracer uptake in tissues and tumour cells.
A diabetic patient may be instructed to take pre-procedure insulin dose with a
meal several hours prior to the procedure. Also, fasting for a certain period of
time prior to the procedure may be required. If plasma glucose level is <120
mg/dl the FDG PET study can be performed. If plasma glucose level is >120
mg/dl the FDG PET study may be rescheduled or the patient excluded depending
on the patient circumstances and the need for the test being conducted.
•
Since medications such as tranquilizers and sedatives, and alcohol act as CNS
depressants, while caffeine and nicotine in tobacco and smoking act as CNS
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
98
stimulants, their consumption should be avoided a day prior to testing to avoid
false results on scans.
•
Some of the administered FDG might be excreted in small amounts in breast
milk. Therefore, milk should be collected and discarded for 2 hours after the
scan following which normal breast feeding can be resumed.
Advantages of PET-CT scan
•
PET-CT scan provides information on both function and anatomic structure of
the brain and spinal cord that is unattainable using other imaging procedures.
•
PET-CT scan results help in more accurate diagnosis of various neurological
disorders.
•
PET-CT scans are less expensive than exploratory surgery and yield more precise
information.
•
By identifying changes in the body at the cellular level, PET imaging may detect
the early onset of disease before it is evident on other imaging tests such as CT
or MRI.
Disadvantages of PET CT scan
•
Injection of the radiotracer may cause pain and inflammation.
•
PET CT scans are time consuming.
•
Test results of diabetic patients or patients who have eaten within a few hours
prior to the examination can be adversely affected because of altered blood
sugar or blood insulin levels.
•
Because the radioactive substance decays quickly and is effective for only a
short period of time, late arrival of the patient for the test may require
rescheduling the procedure for another day.

14. Functional MRI
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a very specialized imaging test
which is ordered by a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. It is a functional neuroimaging
procedure that uses MRI technology to measure activity of neurons in the brain and
spinal cord by detecting associated changes in blood flow in the area of activation.
When neurons of a particular brain or spinal cord area become active, blood flow to
that area increases bringing in more oxygenated haemoglobin which is diamagnetic
(resistant to magnetism) than deoxygenated haemoglobin which is paramagnetic
(attracted to magnetism). While performing an MRI scan, this difference in rising
oxygenated haemoglobin level gives rise to an improved MR signal, since diamagnetic
blood interferes less with the magnetic MR signal. This improvement is mapped and
represented graphically by color coding according to the strengths of activation, to
show which neurons are active at the time of a particular task during MRI scanning.
Procedure
fMRI detects differences in brain activity involved in a sensory, motor, cognitive
function or a behavioral function. During the fMRI procedure, the patient is asked to
alternatively perform a specific task or is stimulated to trigger several processes or
emotions. The stimuli can be grouped in blocks (e.g. 30s-long) or presented as events.
Each of the conditions is repeated several times and separated by rest periods. The
combination of these conditions is called an fMRI paradigm. Tasks like tapping the
fingers, toes, moving feet up and down are commanded to perform to study activation
of the areas involved in motor function. To study areas of activation in sensory
function, sensory stimuli like stroking with a brush along a particular dermatome
(cutaneous), viewing pictures (visual), listening to an audio (auditory), smelling an
odour (olfactory), tasting a substance (gustatory) may be presented. Many cognitive
and language paradigms also exist, which include word generation (prompted by a
letter), semantic decision making (e.g., is the displayed word a vegetable?), and even
simple auditory presentation of words. Though motor tasks and cutaneous sensory
stimuli are mainly used in clinical fMRI studies, other tasks and stimuli are used in
studies conducting research.
Uses of brain fMRI

Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
104
15. Electroencephalography
Electroencephalography is the neurophysiologic measurement of the electrical activity
of the brain OBTAINED by recording from electrodes placed on the scalp or, in
special cases, subdurally or in the cerebral cortex. The resulting traces are known as
an electroencephalogram (EEG) and represent an electrical signal (postsynaptic
potentials) from a large number of neurons.
Clinical use
EEG in various forms is most useful as a tool for monitoring and diagnosis in certain
clinical situations:
•
Seizure and epilepsy: to detect seizure focus and monitor the effects of treatment
•
Disorders with coexisting seizures: in cases of autism, cp, etc, where the patient
may not have experienced a seizure attack or shown symptoms, EEG can
efficiently detect a possible underlying epileptic focus
•
Sleep disorders
•
Eating disorders
•
Coma and brain death
•
Dementia
Procedure
In conventional scalp EEG, the recording is obtained by placing electrodes on the
scalp, after preparing the scalp area BY applying a conductive gel to reduce impedance.
Modern EEG systems have the subject wear a plastic cap where the electrodes are
inserted in small holes.
Electrode placement is determined by measuring and marking the scalp using a system
called the 10-20 system. Each electrode is connected to an input of a differential
amplifier (one amplifier per pair of electrodes), which amplifies the voltage between
them (typically 1,000-100,000 times, or 60-100 dB of voltage gain). The resulting voltage
signal is filtered by a high-pass filter and a low-pass filter, typically set at 0.5 Hz and
35-70 Hz, respectively. The high-pass filter typically filters out slow electrogalvanic
105
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
signals, whereas the low-pass filter filters out electromyographic signals.
The filtered signal is then output on paper (in older systems), or displayed on a
computer screen. The amplitude of the EEG is about 100 μV when measured on the
scalp, and about 1-2 mV when measured on the surface of the brain.
Standard EEG: During a standard EEG, the patient is asked to breathe deeply for
some minutes, look at a flashing light, etc. These activities change the electrical activity
in the brain which shows on the computer. The patient is asked to keep as still as
possible during the test. Any movement can change the electrical activity in the brain,
which can affect the results.
Advantages
•
Less expensive than other functional imaging tests.
•
The time resolution is very high.
•
EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain directly.
Limitations
•
Scalp electrodes are not sensitive enough to pick UP individual action potentials.
•
It cannot differentiate whether the resulting electrical activity is releasing
inhibitory, excitatory or modulatory neurotransmitters.
•
EEG has limited anatomical specificity when compared with other functional
brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Activity types
The EEG activity is of two types: (1) rhythmic activity and (2) transients.
Rhythmic activity is divided into the following bands depending on the frequency:
•
Delta: These waves are normally found only when a person is asleep or in young
children. abnormal activity may indicate subcortical lesions, diffuse lesions,
metabolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus, deep midline lesions
•
Theta: These waves are normally found only when a person is asleep or in young
children. abnormal activity may indicate focal subcortical lesions, metabolic
encephalopathy, deep midline disorders, hydrocephalus
•
Alpha: Alpha waves are present only in the waking state when eyes are closed
but the person is mentally alert. present abnormally in coma
•
Beta: Abnormal activity present in patients on benzodiazepines
•
Gamma: A decrease in gamma band activity may indicate cognitive decline
•
Mu: Limited Mu activity may indicate working of motor mirror neurons (as in
autism).

Sleep EEG
Sleep EEG is ordered in cases where seizures occur during sleep, or in fatigued state,
or when the awake EEG is normal.
Sleep-deprived EEG
A sleep-deprived EEG is done when standard awake EEG did not show any unusual
electrical activity.
Normal EEG
•
In adults who are awake, the EEG shows mostly alpha waves and beta waves.
•
The two sides of the brain show similar patterns of electrical activity.
•
There are no abnormal bursts of electrical activity.
•
On photic stimulation, one area of the brain (the occipital region) shows a brief
response after each flash of light, the brain waves being normal.
Abnormal EEG
•
If the two sides of the brain show different patterns of electrical activity, it may
indicate a problem in one area or side of the brain.
•
Sudden bursts of electrical activity (spikes) or sudden slowing of brain waves
may be caused by a brain tumor, infection, injury, stroke, or epilepsy. In many
patients with epilepsy, the EEG may appear completely normal between seizures.
•
Presence of delta waves or too many theta waves in awake EEG of adults may
indicate presence of a brain injury or a brain illness.
•
The EEG which shows no electrical activity in the brain (a flat or straight line
EEG) means that the brain function has stopped. This may be due lack of oxygen
or blood flow to the brain, or when a person is in coma, or even in cases of
severe drug induced sedation.

16. Electromyography and Nerve
Conduction Studies
Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic technique used for recording the
electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. An electromyograph is used to detect
the electrical potentials generated by muscle cells when they are neurologically or
electrically activated. These signals are then analyzed to evaluate normal or abnormal
activation level and recruitment of muscle fibers in various disorders of muscles and
nerves of central nervous system as well as peripheral nervous system.
There are two kinds of EMG: surface EMG and intramuscular (needle and fine-wire)
EMG using surface electrodes and needle electrodes respectively. Surface EMG is
unable to assess the same muscle activity as when the needle is inserted through a
muscle. Therefore, needle EMG is commonly used in clinical settings.
The activities recorded during an EMG are: A) Insertional activity - Normal muscles
at rest generate some normal electrical signals when the needle is inserted into them.
B) Spontaneous activity at rest - Nil muscle activity is seen normally. Abnormal
spontaneous activity might indicate some nerve and/or muscle pathology. C)
Voluntary recruitment - The patient is asked to contract the muscle and electrical
activity is recorded. The shape, size, and frequency of the resulting electrical signals
are analyzed.
EMG characteristics in neuropathies and myopathies.
o
Neuropathic disease shows the following EMG characteristics:
•
An action potential amplitude that is twice normal due to the increased
number of fibers per motor unit because of reinnervation of denervated
fibers
•
An increase in duration of the action potential
•
A decrease in the number of motor units in the muscle
o
Myopathic disease shows the following EMG characteristics:
•
A decrease in duration of the action potential
•
A reduction in the area to amplitude ratio of the action potential
•
A decrease in the number of motor units in the muscle
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
110
Abnormal EMG finding
•
Insertional activity:
This activity is decreased in atrophied muscle or fatty tissue. Whereas, it is
increased in conditions that cause membrane instability, such as neuropathies,
radiculopathies, and inflammatory myopathies.
•
Spontaneous activity at rest:
Abnormal fibrillation potentials result from motor axonal loss that is not balanced
by reinnervation in conditions such as inflammatory myopathies and direct muscle
injury. Low-amplitude fibrillation potentials suggest that denervation has
occurred in the remote past, whereas high-amplitude fibrillation potentials
suggest an ongoing active denervation process.
•
Voluntary muscle recruitment:
Reduced recruitment signifies motor axonal loss or focal demyelination or
conduction block. Whereas, increased recruitment with a small voluntary force
suggests a myopathy.
•
Interpretation:
EMG study is combined with nerve conduction studies for better interpretation
of results.
Uses
•
To identify neuromuscular disorders
•
To diagnose peripheral nerve compression or injury (eg. Carpal tunnel syndrome,
Cubital tunnel syndrome)
•
To identify nerve root compression or injury (eg. due to herniated intervertebral
disc, sciatica)
•
To check for causes of muscle weakness and wasting and help differentiate
between neuropathy and myopathy
•
To diagnose muscle disorders such as muscular dystrophy
•
To evaluate motor problems such as involuntary muscle twitching (eg. Motor
neuron disease)
•
To diagnose disorders those affect the motor neurons in the spinal cord, such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or polio
•
To diagnose diseases affecting the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia
gravis
Indications
EMG is indicated when there is:
•
Weakness in the limb/s
111
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
Pain in the limb/s
•
Suspected spinal nerve compression
•
Suspected neurologic injury or disorder affecting peripheral nerves
Contraindications
•
Patients with bleeding disorders (eg. haemophilia) and patients receiving
anticoagulant therapy, since the needle electrodes may cause bleeding within
the muscle.
•
Patients with skin infections, since there is a risk of spreading infection from the
skin to the muscle.
•
Patients on medications such as skeletal muscle relaxants, cholinergics, and
anticholinergics, since they affect muscle activity and EMG may show false test
results. These medications may need to be stopped at least three days prior to
EMG testing.
•
Patients with impaired consciousness or cognition, who cannot understand
commands given during the procedure.
Precautions
•
In patients with gross oedema, skin puncture by needle electrodes may result in
leakage of serous fluid for a long time. The fluid may also contain bacteria which
may increase the risk of cellulitis. So, EMG study should be avoided or postponed.
•
Swelling or bleeding in muscles or excess fat (obesity) may interfere with the
transmission of electrical waves to the electrodes, and thereby alter the EMG
results.
Limitations
•
Excess of adipose tissue (fat) affects the EMG recordings.
•
Needle and wire introduction into the muscles is painful.
•
Even if surface EMG technique is used, it only measures potentials of superficial
muscles and provide comparatively less information about the state of diseased
muscle.
Nerve Conduction Studies
A nerve conduction study (NCS) is an electrodiagnostic test used to evaluate the
electrical conduction, and thus the function of the motor and sensory nerves of the
body.
Uses
•
Uses of sensory NCS include evaluating parasthesias (numbness, tingling,
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
112
burning sensations) in a limb or a part of the limb (eg. Carpal tunnel syndrome,
Guyon's canal syndrome, peroneal neuropathy), in two or more limbs or parts
of the limbs (eg. Guillain-Barré syndrome, diabetic neuropathy)
•
Uses of motor NCS include evaluating weakness in muscle/s of limb/s (eg. nerve
root compression due to herniated disc, motor neuron disease, muscular
dystrophy, poliomyelitis)
Indications
NCS is indicated when there is:
•
Weakness in the limb/s
•
Parasthesias in the limb/s
•
Pain in the limb/s
•
Suspected spinal nerve compression
•
Suspected neurologic injury or disorder affecting peripheral nerves
The nerve conduction study consists of the following components:
•
Motor NCS
•
Sensory NCS
•
F wave study
•
H-reflex study
Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) is a common measurement made during this test.
NCV refers to the speed with which electrical impulses travel through a particular
nerve.
Procedure: Flat electrodes are placed on the skin at intervals along the nerve course.
Low-intensity electrical impulses are passed through these electrodes to stimulate
the nerve. The impulses (sensory/motor) produced by this electrical current are
recorded and viewed on an oscilloscope or computer screen. The recorded impulses
are then evaluated to determine the speed with which the impulses travel through
the nerves.
Motor NCS
Motor NCS are performed by electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve and recording
from a muscle supplied by this nerve. The time taken by the electrical impulse to
travel from the stimulation site to the recording site is called the latency and is
measured in milliseconds (ms). The size of the response (amplitude) is measured in
millivolts (mV). Stimulation is carried out at two or more different locations
along the same nerve to determine difference in latencies. The distance between the
different stimulating electrodes and the difference in latencies are used to calculate
the velocity.
113
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Sensory NCS
Sensory NCS are performed by electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve and
recording from a purely sensory portion of the nerve, such as on a finger. The sensory
NCV is also calculated the same way as for motor NCV.
F-wave study
F-wave study uses supramaximal current intensity to stimulate a motor nerve, action
potentials of which travel through the nerve in an anti-dromic direction, from the
site of the stimulating electrode in the limb to the spinal cord's ventral horn and back
to the limb in the same nerve that was stimulated. Action potentials from a muscle
supplied by the nerve are recorded. The F-wave latency is used to derive the
conduction velocity of nerve between the limb and spinal cord.
H-reflex study
H-reflex study uses stimulation of a nerve and recording the reflex action potential
from a muscle in the limb. This also evaluates conduction between the limb and the
spinal cord, but in this case, the afferent impulses are in sensory nerves while the
efferent impulses are in motor nerves.
Interpretation
Different pathological processes result in changes in latencies, amplitudes of the motor
and/or sensory nerves or slowing of the conduction velocities to differing degrees.
Possible causes for abnormal result:
•
axonopathy (damage to the nerve cell)
•
conduction block (an obstacle to the impulse conduction within the nerve)
•
demyelination (damage to the myelin sheath)
Contraindications
There are no specific contraindications for this test. But, precautions need to be taken
in the following cases:
•
In patients with pacemakers, deep brain stimulators or spinal cord stimulators,
stimulating electrodes placed in close proximity to these devices could induce a
voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the functioning of these devices. Thus,
special precautions must be taken while performing NCS on them.
•
Patients with impaired consciousness or cognition, who cannot understand
commands given during the procedure and who cannot bear the electrical
stimulations.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
114
17. Evoked Potentials
Evoked potential (EP) tests measure the electrical activity in the brain in response to
stimulation of specific sensory nerve pathways such as sight, sound, or touch. Minute
electrical signals are evoked in the brain in response to these sensory stimuli. These
signals travel along the sensory nerves and through afferent pathways of the spinal
cord to respective regions of the brain and are picked up by electrodes, amplified,
and displayed on a computer. EPs, thus, are able to detect the slowing or blockage of
electrical conduction (eg. demyelination) along these pathways.
Uses of SSEP test:
•
Primary use is to determine compromised central nervous system (CNS)
conduction.
•
To diagnose nerve entrapment syndromes such as carpal tunnel syndrome/ulnar
nerve entrapment syndrome.
•
To diagnose spondylytic myeloradiculopathy
•
To diagnose thoracic outlet syndrome
•
To diagnose and manage acquired metabolic disorders (e.g., lead toxicity, B12
deficiency)
•
To help reveal asymptomatic lesions, for example in case of suspected multiple
sclerosis.
•
To confirm presence of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis;
diagnosis of which requires evidence of demyelination in two distinct areas of
the central nervous system.
•
Abnormalities of trigeminal SSEPs may guide towards diagnosis of MS,
Wallenberg syndrome, cerebellopontine angle tumors, trigeminal neuromas, or
meningeal sarcoidosis with facial paralysis.
•
To help confirm symptoms when few physical findings are noted
•
To establish an anatomic region where the conduction disturbance or block occurs
•
To detect tumors or other problems affecting the brain and spinal cord
115
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
To check prognosis in comatosed patients in anoxic brain injury
•
To study fundamental aspects of sensory physiology for research purposes
Indications
•
To assess patients with acute spinal cord injury
•
To evaluate acute anoxic encephalopathy
•
To evaluate patients with suspected stroke
•
To confirm or reject the presence of a suspected conduction block.
•
To identify clinically silent brain lesions such as multiple sclerosis suspects, in
whom neurological signs and other objective findings (brain plaques on MRI
and/or positive oligoclonal bands in CSF) are present.
•
To assess and follow up for prognosis in patients with spinocerebellar
degeneration (e.g. Friedreich's ataxia, olivopontocerebellar degeneration)
•
In unexplained myelopathy
•
To evaluate radiculopathy, neuropathy
Different types of evoked potentials studies
•
Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) test: This test helps detect problems
with cutaneous sensations which may be due to segmental innervation
disturbances, disturbances in the spinal cord, demyelination, etc.
•
Visual evoked potential (VEP) test: This test helps detect problems with the
optic nerves that affect sight.
•
Brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) test: This test helps detect problems
with hearing due to nerve damage or brain stem tumors and multiple sclerosis.
Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) testing is commonly used in clinical settings.
During the procedure, electrodes are attached to the wrist, the back of the knee, or
other locations depending on the dermatome to be studied. A mild electrical stimulus
is applied through the electrodes. Electrodes placed on the scalp then pick up the
response from corresponding brain area and the time taken for the current to travel
along the nerve to the brain is recorded. Abnormalities may include prolonged
latencies or lack of development of the SSEP. The stimulation sites commonly used
for clinical diagnostic SSEP studies are the median nerve at the wrist, the common
peroneal nerve at the knee, and the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle.
The dorsal columns in the spinal cord are mainly responsible for conduction of the
electrical activity that generates the SSEP. While in the brain, the lemniscal and
thalamocortical pathways are involved. Because the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis
requires evidence of demyelination in two distinct areas of the central nervous system,
EP testing can help confirm multiple sclerosis.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
116
Visual evoked potential (VEP) testing
Visual stimuli used in VEP testing are strobe flash, flashing light-emitting diodes
(LEDs), transient and steady state pattern reversal and pattern onset/offset. The
most common stimulus used is a checkerboard pattern, which reverses every half-
second. The VEP is used to identify impaired transmission along the optic nerve
pathways, which is a common early finding in MS, even in some patients who have
never experienced any visual symptoms. It is used to detect problems with the
conducting nerves and areas of the brain involved in vision in cases of optic neuritis,
occipital trauma, or neurofibromatosis, etc.
Brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) testing
In BAEP testing, broad-band clicks as stimuli are used for the neurologic applications
of auditory evoked potentials. BAEPs reflect neuronal activity in the auditory nerve,
cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and inferior colliculus of the brainstem. Abnormal
test results may be a sign of hearing loss, multiple sclerosis, acoustic neuroma,
brainstem stroke, or brainstem degenerative disorders, etc. BAEP testing may also
be used for outcome prediction in cases of coma.
Contraindications
There are no specific contraindications for this test. But, precautions need to be taken
in the following cases:
•
In patients with pacemakers, deep brain stimulators or spinal cord stimulators,
stimulating electrodes placed in close proximity to these devices could induce a
voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the functioning of these devices. Thus,
special precautions must be taken while performing SSEP testing on them.
•
Patients with impaired consciousness or cognition, who cannot understand
commands given during the procedure and who cannot bear the electrical
stimulations.
Advantages
•
SSEP testing may help diagnose a problem even when the neurologic change is
too subtle to be noticed by the patient or to show up on neurological examination.
Limitations
•
Abnormalities demonstrated by these tests are etiologically nonspecific and do
not guide towards a specific diagnosis. Therefore, the test results should be
integrated carefully into the clinical situation by the concerned physician.
•
Though evoked potential studies are considered safe procedures, the test may
cause discomfort in hyperalgesic patients and children.

18. Blood Tests
In neurological disorders, clinical history and examination is the key to identify the
diagnosis. Radiological investigations, for e.g. CT, MRI, are required to confirm the
diagnosis and differentiate between various causes. Blood tests are adjunctive and
offer added information about systemic causes or effects of neurological disorders.
Blood tests are especially important in CNS infections, seizures, nutritional deficiencies
and metabolic disorders. Here we have described the commonly used blood tests in
patients presenting with neurological complaints.
I.
Routine blood tests
Complete blood count
White blood cells (WBC)
Normal ranges
•
WBC - 4-10 x 109/L
•
Neutrophils - 2.0-7.0×109/L
•
Lymphocytes - 1.0-3.0×109/L
•
Monocytes - 0.2-1.0×109/L
•
Eosinophils - 0.02-0.5×109/L
•
Basophils - 0.02-0.1×109/L
•
Peripheral WBC count increases significantly after a generalized seizure and is
probably transient in nature.
•
High WBC count (consisting predominantly of PMNs) in bacterial meningitis
•
Higher than normal numbers of lymphocytes or monocytes - some types of
cancers
•
Neutropenia - in cancer, viral infections such as influenza, bacterial infections
such as tuberculosis, or deficiencies of vitamin B12 or folate (folic acid).
•
Neutrophil granulocytes - May indicate bacterial infection. May also be raised
in acute viral infections
119
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
Monocytes - May be raised in bacterial infection, tuberculosis, malaria
•
Eosinophil granulocytes - increased in parasitic infections, or allergic reaction.
Platelet
Platelet abnormalities could be the underlying cause of some of the neurological
disorders.
Normal value: 150-400 × 109
•
Thrombocytosis (increased platelet count) may present as:
–
Headache, transient ischaemic episodes, paraesthesias
–
Other transient symptoms may include dizziness, dysarthria, syncope,
migraine, seizures, etc.
•
Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) may cause bleeding in the brain leading
to stroke or hematoma.
•
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may present as:
–
hallucinations, bizarre behavior, altered mental status, stroke, headaches
Haemoglobin level
Normal ranges:
•
Men: 13.8 to 18.0 g/dL
•
Women: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL
•
Children: 11 to 16 g/dL
•
Pregnant women: 11 to 14 g/dL
Headache may be a symptom of anemia due to decreased oxygenation of the brain
tissues.
Polycythemia vera (increased RBC count) may present as headaches, lack of
concentration, fatigue and thromboembolic stroke (due to increased blood clotting
tendencies).
Creatinine level
Normal value: 0.5 to 1.2 mg/dL
Renal failure can lead to increased levels of creatinine, which in turn can cause
electrolyte imbalance leading to seizures. Also, drug dosing errors in patients with
renal impairment can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs
cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular
filtration rate.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
120
Prothrombin time tests (PT-INR)
The prothrombin time (PT) test and international normalized ratio (INR) test examine
the integrated function of all of the coagulation factors.
Normal PT:
12-13 seconds, Normal INR: 0.8-1.2
PT-INR should be checked in haemorrhagic stroke (bleeding tendencies). Regular
PT-INR check up will be required in patients with ischemic stroke who are on anti-
coagulants.
ESR
Normal ranges:
0-22 mm/hr for men and 0-29 mm/hr for women
Elevated ESR should raise suspicion of tuberculosis and malignancies. In these
conditions, there is very high ESR level. A borderline increased ESR may be non-
specific due to chronic inflammation.
II.
Vitamins
Vitamin B12
Normal value:  130-700 ng/L
A full blood count which shows anaemia and macrocytosis should prompt the
practitioner to look for a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate. Tests commonly used
for the detection of these vitamin deficiencies are serum folate, red cell folate and
serum B12 concentrations.
Deficiency may cause:
•
unexplained neurological or neuropsychiatric abnormalities.
•
peripheral neuropathy and sub-acute combined degeneration of the spinal cord
•
paraesthesias, weakness, clumsiness, and an unsteady gait (ataxia)
•
senile dementia or Alzheimer disease; memory loss, irritability, and personality
changes in elders
B12 toxicity may present with similar complaints of deficiency. For e.g. numbness,
paresthesias, headaches, giddiness, etc. Therefore, B12 level is required to distinguish
between toxicity and deficiency. Also, history of whether the patient was on B12
supplements will help to differentiate.
Vitamin E
Normal value:  5.5-17 μg/mL
121
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Deficiency may cause:
•
Ataxia
•
Progressive spinocerebellar syndrome
•
Peripheral neuropathy
•
Cranial neuropathy with ophthalmoplegia
•
Dysarthria
•
Psychomotor impairment
•
Myopathy
III. Serum Immunoglobulins
•
IgG is increased in chronic phases of inflammatory diseases of CNS, multiple
sclerosis, Lyme disease, neuromyelitisoptica, neurosarcoidosis and GBS
Oligoclonal bands are bands of immunoglobulins that are seen in patient's blood
serum or cerebrospinal fluid on protein electrophoresis. IgG in normal CSF
migrates as a faint diffuse zone, but in demyelinating diseases, IgG migrates as
discrete oligoclonal bands. The presence of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal
fluid combined with their absence in blood serum often indicates that
immunoglobulins are produced in central nervous system resulting from viral
and bacterial infections, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, when investigating
CNS diseases, bands in serum are subtracted from bands in CSF. Presence of
oligoclonal bands in serum as well as CSF may indicate presence of multiple
sclerosis, myelitis, neoplastic meningitis and CNS inflammatory disorders.
IV. Disease specific tests
•
Myasthenia gravis
The anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody test is the most reliable test
for diagnosing autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) in most of the patients.
The anti-striated muscle (anti-SM) Ab is present in about 84% of patients with thymoma
who are younger than 40 years and less often in those without thymoma. Thus, a
positive test result should guide towards checking the presence of thymoma in patients
younger than 40 years.
Seronegative (negative for anti-AChR Ab) patients should be referred for antibodies
to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) testing. Anti-MuSK-positive individuals tend to have
more pronounced bulbar weakness and may have tongue and facial atrophy. They
may have neck, shoulder and respiratory involvement without ocular weakness. Also,
response to acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitors is oftenly less, with chances of
symptoms getting worse.

Striational antibodies are found in almost all the patients with thymoma and MG,
and late-onset MG patients; while rarely in anti-AChR-negative patients. Presence of
these antibodies should raise a strong suspicion of thymoma in a young patient with
MG.
Testing for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) is indicated to rule
out systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
•
Muscular dystrophy
Increased Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels are indicative of muscle disease.
Thus, CPK testing is the most specific test for muscular dystrophy. CPK levels are 50-
300 times greater than normal levels in the early phases of disease, but the levels
decrease as the muscle mass decreases. The CPK level is highest in Duchenne MD,
with comparatively lesser level in Becker MD.
•
GuillianBarre syndrome
Antibodies to glycolipids and gangliosides are observed in the sera of most of
the patients with GBS during the acute phase.
Antibodies to GM1 are frequently found in the sera of patients with the acute motor
axonal neuropathy (AMAN) or acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP)
variants of GBS.
Anti-GM1 antibodies titers may be elevated with C jejuni infections.
Anti-GQ1b antibodies are found in GBS patients with ophthalmoplegia and the Miller-
Fisher variant.
Assays for antibodies to C jejuni, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes simplex
virus, HIV, and Mycoplasma pneumonia infections may be considered in GBS. HIV
has been reported to precede GBS. Thus, testing should be done in high-risk patients
to check for possible infection with this agent.
•
Cerebral malaria
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are being used for emergency medical screening
and in medical facilities with limited resources. These tests target antigen HRP-2
from P. falciparum.
Immunochromatographic tests detect antibodies to histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2),
parasite LDH (pLDH), or Plasmodium aldolase, and are very specific.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests target the detection of small-subunit 18S rRNA
and circumsporozoite (CS) genes. In patients with low levels of parasitemia, PCR-
based technique is the most reliable test for detecting malaria parasites.
V.
Peripheral smears
123
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
Cerebral malaria
Manifestations of cerebral malaria include impairment of consciousness (confusion,
delirium, obtundation, stupor, or coma), convulsions, focal neurologic deficit, and
psychosis.
Demonstration of asexual form of P. falciparum in peripheral blood smear, in thick
and thin blood smear films stained by Giemsa stain is required for the diagnosis.
Absence of parasites in some patients may be due to sequestration of parasitized
RBCs in cerebral circulation or earlier treatment with antimalarial drugs. In such a
situation, at least 3 smears 6 hours apart should be examined. At least 3 smears
should be negative before excluding cerebral malaria.
•
Tuberculous meningitis
AFB testing is used to identify an active tuberculosis (TB) infection caused by the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An AFB smear is used as a rapid test to detect
mycobacteria. A molecular test for TB called nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)
may be done in conjunction with an AFB smear.
AFB blood and CSF cultures are used to diagnose active M. tuberculosis infections,
infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria, or to determine whether TB-like
symptoms are due to another cause. Susceptibility testing is done to determine the
most effective antibiotic to treat the mycobacterial infection.
VI. Specific biomarkers
•
Homocysteine
–
Significant in cases of stroke
–
Homocystinuria- causes mental retardation, seizures
–
Hyperhomocystinemia - associated with arterial and venous thrombosis
and should be distinguished from autosomal recessive homocystinuria.
–
Elevated homocysteine levels are found in the elderly, in patients with
vitamin B6 and B12 deficiency; and in renal insufficiency. Testing should be
done in young adults in case of stroke. Fasting homocysteine level is
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
fluorescence detection.

Diffuse peripheral neuropathy primarily affects the limbs, damaging the nerves
of the feet and hands. Autonomic neuropathy is the other form of diffuse
neuropathy and it affects the heart and other internal organs.
125
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
Focal or localized diabetic neuropathy affects specific nerves, most commonly in
the torso, leg, or head.
Normal ranges:
•
Fasting plasma glucose: 70-99 mg/dL
•
Postprandial plasma glucose at 2 hours: Less than 140 mg/dL
•
Random plasma glucose: Less than 140 mg/dL
X.
Lipid profile
Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor of stroke. Therefore, it is very important to
check the lipid profile and do preventive measures.
High LDL and Total cholesterol, low HDL significantly increase the chances of stroke.
Normal ranges:
•
Triglycerides: 50-150 mg/dL
•
Total cholesterol: 3-5.5 mmol/L

XIII.
Genetic testing
•
Congenital myopathies - muscular dystrophies
The PCR method rapidly screens for deletions of the dystrophin gene at exons
3-30 and at exons 44-55. PCR can be used to detect more than 98% of existing
deletions, and it can be performed within 24 hours.
•
Spinal muscular atrophy
Homozygous SMN1 gene deletion is highly specific and sensitive for the
diagnosis of SMA. In patients with suspected disease and no gene deletion,
SMN1copy testing with sequencing of coding regions of SMN1 copy is suggested.
•
Epileptic seizures
Mutations in one of several genes can cause or increase susceptibility to juvenile
myoclonic epilepsy. The genes commonly studied are the GABRA1 gene and
the EFHC1 gene.
Potassium channel subunit gene mutation (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) is found in benign
familial neonatal seizures; while, mutations of LGI1 gene is found in autosomal
dominant epilepsy with auditory features.
Patients with the syndrome of epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures show
GLUT1 deficiency. The gene tested for the cause of deficiency is SLC2A1.
•
Huntington's disease
Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset, autosomal dominant inherited
disorder. Genetic testing may not be necessary in a patient with a typical clinical
picture and a family history of HD. However, in the absence of a family history
of HD, patients should undergo genetic testing to exclude or confirm HD. In
normal individuals, CAG - tri-nucleotide repeat occurs between 11 and 29 times.
In people with Huntington's disease, the repeat occurs over and over again,
from 40 times to more than 80. Genetic testing, thus detects CAG repeat number
for each allele.
•
Hereditary ataxias
Various genes responsible for ataxia have been identified in spinocerebellar ataxia
types 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 28; dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy

oculomotor apraxia types 1 and 2; Marinesco-Sjogren Syndrome; ataxia with
Vitamin E deficiency; fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome; mitochondrial
recessive ataxia syndrome; autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-
Saguenay (ARSACS); and episodic ataxia types 1 and 2.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Various specific gene mutations have been described in familial ALS. Mutation
in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene, also known as ALS1 is
the most common finding in genetic testing. Other genes most commonly involved
in familial ALS are C9orf72, FUS (ALS6) and TARDBP (ALS10).

19. Cerebrospinal Fluid
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a vital fluid found in the brain and spinal cord. CSF is
examined to diagnose a variety of neurological disorders. CSF is collected by a method
called lumbar puncture.
Procedure
Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into
the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF
is extracted through the needle, and tested for cell count, and physical, chemical and
microbiological characteristics.
Risks
Risks associated with lumbar puncture include:
•
bleeding from the puncture site into the spinal fluid (traumatic tap)
•
discomfort during and after the procedure
•
allergic reaction to the anaesthetic
•
infection at the puncture site
•
headache after the test
•
adhesive arachnoiditis
•
trauma to the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots resulting in weakness or loss of
sensation, or even paraplegia
Indications
CSF testing is done in the presence of following signs and symptoms:
•
severe, unremitting headache
•
stiff neck
•
hallucinations, confusion, or dementia
•
seizures
129
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
fever that persist or intensifies
•
fatigue, lethargy, muscle weakness
•
changes in consciousness
•
severe nausea
•
light sensitivity
•
numbness or tremor
•
dizziness
•
speaking difficulties
•
trouble walking or poor coordination
•
severe mood swings
•
intractable clinical depression
•
In infants - when they are irritable, cry when they are held, have body stiffness,
refuse food, and have bulging fontanelles
Contraindications
Lumbar puncture should not be performed in the following situations:
•
Idiopathic increased intracranial pressure (ICP), because it can lead to brain
herniation.
•
Age >65, reduced GCS, recent history of seizure- A CT or MRI scan is indicated
instead
•
Bleeding disorders
•
Skin infection at puncture site
•
Sepsis
•
Hypertension with bradycardia and deteriorating consciousness
•
Cardiorespiratory compromise
•
Skeletal deformities of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis)
Common findings
Physical Characteristics
v
Pressure of the CSF can be measured when starting CSF collection.
•
Normal: 90-180 mm H2O
•
Increased CSF pressure may indicate tumour, infection, hydrocephalus, or
bleeding.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
130
•
Decreased pressure may be due to dehydration, shock, or leakage of CSF
through an abnormal opening.
v
Colour of the fluid - normally it is clear and colourless.
•
Yellow, orange, or pink CSF may indicate the breakdown of blood cells
due to bleeding into the CSF or the presence of bilirubin.
•
Green CSF may indicate presence of bilirubin or infection.
v
Turbidity - Cloudy or turbid CSF may indicate the presence of white or red
blood cells, microorganisms, or an increase in protein levels.
v
Viscosity - Normal CSF will have the same consistency as water. Thicker
consistency of CSF may indicate certain types of cancers or meningitis.
Chemical Tests
•
CSF glucose -Normal: 50-80 mg/dL (or greater than two-thirds of blood glucose).
Glucose levels may decrease in the presence of bacteria or inflammatory cells
(WBCs) or tumour cells.
•
CSF protein - only a small amount is normally present in CSF. Normal: 15-60
mg/dL. Decreases in CSF protein are not generally considered significant.
Increases in protein are most commonly seen with:
–
Meningitis and brain abscess
–
Brain or spinal cord tumors
–
Multiple Sclerosis
–
Guillain-Barré Syndrome
–
Syphilis
Additional CSF testing includes:
•
CSF protein electrophoresis - specific types of proteins are detected. For e.g.
Oligoclonal bands may be seen with multiple sclerosis and Lyme disease. Normal:
0 or 1 band present normally
•
CSF IgG - increased in some conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, herpes
encephalitis, connective tissue diseases.
•
Myelin basic protein - seen in myelin breakdown, such as with multiple sclerosis.
•
CSF lactic acid - often used to distinguish between viral and bacterial meningitis.
The level will usually be increased with bacterial and fungal meningitis while it
will remain normal or only slightly elevated with viral meningitis. Normal: 10-
25 mg/dL
•
CSF lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) - used to differentiate between bacterial and
viral meningitis; the level is usually increased with bacterial meningitis and not
with viral meningitis; may also be elevated with leukemia or stroke. Normal: <
131
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
2.0-7.2 U/mL
•
CSF glutamine - may be increased with liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy or
Reye syndrome. Normal: 6-15 mg/dL
•
CSF C-reactive protein (CRP) - elevated with inflammation. It is markedly
increased with bacterial meningitis.
•
Tumor markers - Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),
and hCG may be increased in metastatic cancers.
Infectious Disease Tests
These tests may be performed to look for microorganisms if meningitis or encephalitis
is suspected.
•
CSF gram stain for direct observation of bacteria and fungi present in CSF under
a microscope
•
CSF culture and sensitivity is used to detect any microorganisms which will
grow in the culture and to select antimicrobial therapy for the affected person
and prophylaxis. Some amoebae, single cell parasites, may also be detected with
a culture.
Additional CSF testing includes:
•
Detection of viruses - detection of viral genetic material (DNA, RNA) by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing; for example, herpes virus and
enteroviruses. The presence of viral antibodies and their increase over time
indicates a recent infection by that virus.
•
CSF Cryptococcal antigen - to detect a fungal infection caused by the yeast
Cryptococcus neoformans
•
Other CSF antigen and antibody tests - may be done depending on which
organism(s) are suspected.
Other CSF tests for infectious diseases that are less commonly done include:
•
CSF AFB smear and culture may be positive with tuberculosis and with other
mycobacteria
•
CSF syphilis testing (VDRL) positive with neurosyphilis.
Microscopic tests
•
CSF total cell counts
–
Red blood cell (RBC) count -Normally no red blood cells are present in the
CSF. The presence of red blood cells may indicate bleeding into the CSF or
may indicate a "traumatic tap" - blood that leaked into the CSF sample
during collection.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
132
–
White blood cell (WBC) count- Normally less than 5 cells are present in the
adult. A significant increase in white blood cells in the CSF is seen with
infection or inflammation of the central nervous system.
•
CSF WBC differential
Small numbers of lymphocytes, monocytes are normal in a sample of CSF. There
may be:
–
an increase in neutrophils with a bacterial infection
–
an increase in lymphocytes with a viral or fungal infection, immune disorders
(multiple sclerosis)
–
sometimes an increase in eosinophils with a parasitic infection
•
CSF cytology
A cytocentrifuged sample is treated with a special stain and examined under a
microscope for tumour cells.

20. Brain Stroke
Stroke is a focal neurological deficit which occurs due to disruption of blood supply.
The blood vessels are either blocked by a clot (ischemia) or they are ruptured leading
to a hemorrhage. This further affects the oxygen supply to the brain causing brain
damage.
Risk Factors:
A – Age and Anxiety and Atrial fibrillation
B – Body built (obesity)
C – Cigarette Smoking and Cardiac disease
D – Diabetes/ Diet
E – Exercise lack
F – Family History
G – Gout
H – Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and homocystinemia
antiphospholipid antibodies, metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia) are also risk factors for stroke.
Types
There are three main types of strokes namely ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke
and TIA (transient ischemic attack).
TIA (transient ischemic attack)
The sudden onset of a focal and transient (<24 hours) neurological deficit due to
brain ischemia. This type of stroke is called a mini stroke. It is usually caused due to
a temporary clot. However, it should be taken seriously as there are chances of it
leading to ischemic stroke.
Warning Signs
•
Numbness or weakness that starts suddenly, either on the left or right side of
the body (face, arms, or legs are often affected)
135
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
Confusion, difficulty comprehending language, or trouble talking that begins
without warning
•
Sudden vision problems (in one eye or both)
•
Severe, piercing headache, with no clear cause, that starts suddenly
•
Difficulty walking because of sudden loss of balance or dizziness
•
In a TIA, symptoms generally last only about one minute, according to the
American Stroke Association (ASA). Some can last up to five minutes.
•
Blood pressure more than 180/110
•
Any neurodeficit, headache with projectile vomiting.
Ischemic stroke :
This type of stroke occurs due to formation of a clot in the blood vessel obstructing
the blood supply to the brain. 87% of all strokes are ischemic type. There are two
sub-types of ischemic stroke. Embolic stroke in which, the blood clot forms in any
part of the body and eventually reaches the brain. Thrombotic stroke is caused due
to a clot formed in an artery which supplies blood to the brain called thrombosis.
Thrombosis either results due to large vessel thrombosis or small vessel disease also
called lacunar infarction.
Hemorrhagic stroke:
This type of stroke occurs when a weak blood vessel ruptures resulting in bleeding.
Hemorrhagic stroke is further divided into two types. Intracerebral hemorrhage,
wherein a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain tissue,
damaging brain cells. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, wherein the artery which is on or
near the surface of the brain bursts and spills into the space between the surface of
the brain and the skull. This bleeding is often signaled by a sudden, severe headache.
Causes of stroke:
Ischemic strokes are caused due to clots in the blood supplying arteries. These clots
are formed in the already narrowed arteries due to atherosclerosis. Lifestyle risk
factors for atherosclerosis include high cholesterol, smoking, heavy drinking, high
blood pressure, diabetes, etc.
Hemorrhagic stroke is often caused due to conditions like high blood pressure, trauma,
vascular malformations, overtreatment with anticoagulants and aneurysms and
arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
Examination
The F.A.S.T. test is often an easy way to examine and diagnose stroke
Using the F.A.S.T. test involves asking these simple questions:
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
136
Face :
Check the patients face. Has their mouth drooped?
Arms :
Can the patient lift both arms?
Speech: Is the patients speech slurred? Do they understand what the doctor speaks?
Time :
Is critical. When was the patient normal? When did the symptoms start?
Basic examination of all patients includes a neurological and cardiovascular exam
which includes vital signs and carotid auscultation. Check blood sugar by a finger
prick test.  The doctor should identify current medications, especially anticoagulants,
and recent illnesses, surgery, or trauma. The patients should be immediately referred
to the specialized hospital.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential Diagnosis for suspected stroke can include: hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia,
hypercalcemia, seizure, migraine, brain tumor, peripheral vertigo, syncope, subdural
hematoma, acute confusional state (delirium), vasculitis, drug side effect, transient
global amnesia, encephalitis, functional disorder and paroxysmal symptoms of other
neurological disorders including MS, upper cord lesions, radiculopathies and acute
peripheral neuropathies.

137
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Management
Acute ischemic stroke:
The only FDA approved treatment for ischemic strokes is tissue plasminogen activator
which is given through IV to the patient. tPA dissolves the clot and improves blood
flow to the brain. However, it should be administered within 3 - 4 hours to improve
the chances of recovery. A significant number of stroke victims don't get to the hospital
in time for tPA treatment; this is why it's so important to identify a stroke immediately.
Refer to Section F for more details regarding tPA use.
The goal for the acute management of patients with stroke is to stabilize the patient
and to complete initial evaluation and assessment, including imaging and laboratory
studies, within 60 minutes of patient arrival. Critical decisions focus on the need for
intubation, blood pressure control, and determination of risk/benefit for thrombolytic
intervention.
Acute antiplatelet therapy (for secondary stroke prevention; patient assessed
individually)
After intracranial hemorrhage exclusion - for patients not given tPA an immediate
one time dose of 160mg ASA is recommended
For patients who have been given tPA withhold antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy
for first 24hrs, after which, ASA (50-325mg) should be given daily.
Initial Management:
•
Temperature (treat >38°C, as fever may contribute to further brain injury or
indicate complication such as pneumonia)
•
Initial neurological vital signs (Q4H)
Fig. 20.1:  MRI Scan of brain
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
138
•
O2 saturation
•
Blood sugar (treat hypo and hyperglycemia)
•
BP (treat >220 systolic or >120 diastolic cautiously in first 48hrs; aim for reduction
by 10-15% unless otherwise indicated by medical conditions)
•
Heart rhythm (to assess for atrial fibrillation)
•
Swallowing screen (if fails keep NPO until full swallowing assessment)
Blood glucose
Treat hypoglycemia with D50
Treat hyperglycemia with insulin if serum glucose >200
mg/dL
Blood pressure
See recommendations for thrombolysis candidates and
noncandidates.
Cardiac monitor
Continuous monitoring for ischemic changes or atrial
fibrillation
Intravenous fluids
Avoid D5W and excessive fluid administration
IV isotonic sodium chloride solution at 50 mL/h unless
otherwise indicated
Oral intake
NPO initially; aspiration risk is great, avoid oral intake until
swallowing assessed
Oxygen
Supplement if indicated (Sa02 < 94%)
Temperature
Avoid hyperthermia; use oral or rectal acetaminophen and
cooling blankets as neede
Standard haematological and biochemical tests such as a full blood count, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, blood glucose, renal biochemistry and cholesterol level should
be performed on patients with a stroke or TIA as a minimum
Thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA (alteplase 0.9 mg/kg up to maximum 90 mg)
administered within four and a half hours of stroke onset according to protocols
stated in the product licence significantly reduces death and disability at 90 days
Patients admitted with stroke within four and a half hours of definite onset of
symptoms, who are considered suitable, should be treated with 0.9 mg/kg (up to
maximum 90 mg) intravenous rt-PA.
Streptokinase should not be used for treatment of patients in the acute phase of
stroke.
Aspirin 300 mg daily should be commenced within 48 hours of ischaemic stroke and
continued for at least 14 days. ; In patients with dysphagia aspirin (300 mg) should be
administered rectally or by enteral tube.
139
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Aspirin should be avoided within 24 hours of IV or IA thrombolytic therapy.
Anticoagulants - Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
Dosage: 40 mg of enoxaparin subcutaneously daily or 5,000 U unfractionated heparin
subcutaneously every 12 hours.
Indications:
•
If early anticoagulation after ischemic stroke is indicated but UFH is
contraindicated because of large brain infarctions, hemorrhagic infarctions, or
pronounced microangiopathic changes in the brain, LMWH (in a body-weight-
adapted dose) could be used since it carries lower bleeding risk.
•
Conditions with potential high risk of early cardiogenic reembolization, such as
atrial fibrillation with proven intracardial thrombus on echocardiography,
artificial valves, left atrial or ventricular thrombi, or myocardial infarction during
the last 4 weeks
•
Symptomatic dissection of the arteries supplying the brain (after exclusion of
subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT scan)
•
Symptomatic extracranial or intracranial arteriosclerotic stenosis with crescendo
TIAs or early progressive stroke
•
Basilar artery occlusion before or after intra-arterial pharmacological or
mechanical thrombolysis.
•
Known hypercoagulable states (eg, protein C and S deficiencies, activated protein
C [APC] resistance, antithrombin deficiency, relevant titer of antiphospholipid
antibodies)
•
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
Contraindications:
Patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with IV recombinant tPA should not be
treated with anticoagulants for at least 24 hours post thrombolysis.
The use of LMWHs should be avoided in patients with known allergies to LMWHs,
heparin, sulfites or benzyl alcohol, in patients with active major bleeding, or patients
with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Advantages: Compared with UFH, LMW heparins display improved bioavailability
and a more predictable dose response. LMWHs have fewer serious side effects, such
as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced osteopenia and severe
bleeding.
Anti-Platelets and Anti-Coagulants:
They are effective at reducing the risk of another Ischaemic stroke in the future.
These are long term treatments. They are contraindicated after a Haemorrhagic Stroke.
The anti-platelet medications used are:
Aspirin
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
140
Dosage - 75-325 mg daily.
Side effects: bleeding, low platelet, peptic ulcers
Clopidogrel
Dosage- Prophylaxis of Thromboembolic Events: Recommended Dose: 75 mg once
daily.
Side effects:  gastrointestinal hemorrhage, neutropenia, palpitation, syncope, asthenia,
neuralgia, paresthesia and vertigo.
Warfarin
Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed anticoagulant. Warfarin is an anticoagulant
used to reduce the risk of death, recurrent MI, and thromboembolic events such as
stroke or systemic embolization after MI. Monitoring of INR (International Normalised
Ratio) is necessary. The anticoagulant effect of warfarin should be kept at an
international normalised ratio (INR) of about 2.5 (desirable range, 2.0-3.0).
Indications: Warfarin is recommended for Ischaemic stroke with atrial fibrillation
and those who are at high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke.
Contraindications:
Absolute Contraindications to Warfarin
•
Current active bleeding or bleeding disorders
•
Platelet count <50,000
•
Blood pressure consistently >160/90
•
Noncompliance with medication or monitoring
Dosage: Initial: 2 to 5 mg orally or intravenously once a day for 1 to 2 days, then
adjust dose according to results of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or
prothrombin time (PT).
Maintenance: the usual maintenance dose ranges from 2 to 10 mg orally once a day.
Side effects: bleeding, jaundice, oliguria
Dagibatran
It  is a new type of anti-coagulant which acts by direct inhibition of thrombin. The
main advantage offered by dagibatran is that it does not require INR monitoring. It
is a tablet which is taken every day, but it more expensive that other treatments. One
of the side effects of anticoagulants is bleeding.
Management of acute Haemorrhagic stroke is discussed in detail in Section D.
Management of Chronic Stroke
1.
Reduction of high risk factors:
Reduce anxiety, and stress
Lifestyle modifications- healthy diet and exercise regularly, quit smoking
141
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Control diabetes by diet and antidiabetic medicines
Control blood pressure by diet, exercise and antihypertensive medicines
Control cholesterol levels by low fat and low carbohydrate diet, and
anticholesterol medicines
2.
Comprehensive neurorehabilitation:
In the chronic stage of stroke, neurorehabilitation plays a key role in recovery.
Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and psychological
counseling will help in faster and higher degree of recovery.
3.
Medicine:
Antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy may be required to prevent recurrent
ischemic stroke. Aspirin, clopidogrel may be prescribed by the neurologist for
long term after ischemic stroke. Warfarin may have been started in the hospital
by a specialist if there is an underlying cause of recurrent thromboembolic
episode. In these cases, family doctor should keep a close watch on occurrence
of side effects like bleeding. They should also closely monitor INR levels. In
case of any episode of bleeding or high INR, patient should be referred to a
neurologist immediately.
In cases of haemorrhagic stroke, blood pressure monitoring is very important.
Blood pressure should be maintained around 120/80 mm Hg. Antihypertensive
drugs should be prescribed. ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, angiotensin receptor
blockers are prescribed according to the coexisting factors.
4.
Prevention of stroke related complications such as:
•
Deep vein thrombosis - Regular rehabilitation, maximize mobility and in
some cases DVT prophylaxis may be required
•
Spasticity or contracture - Regular rehabilitation will ensure that the range
of motion and tone of the muscles are maintained which will prevent
contracture formation. If the spasticity is hampering the ambulation or day
to day activities, small dose of antispastic medicines may be tried.
•
Shoulder displacement - It may happen because of flaccid shoulder girdle
muscles which may lead to subluxation of shoulder joint. Therefore, it has
to be prevented by giving appropriate shoulder braces and rehabilitation
by a physical or occupational therapist.
•
Pneumonia - In bulbar weakness, aspiration is common which leads to
recurrent pneumonia. Regular speech and swallow therapy is required. Chest
physiotherapy is needed in bed ridden patients.
•
Urinary tract infection - In case of bowel bladder incontinence, proper care
and the catheter hygiene is needed.
•
Pressure ulcer - Pressure ulcers are the common complication in bed ridden
patients, which has to be taken care of by advising proper positioning and
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
142
skin hygiene. Special mattresses like foam mattress, water or air bed which
prevent pressure on pressure prone areas are required. The patient needs
to be turned every two hourly. Keep the skin dry by powder application.
•
Depression - Psychological counseling and family support are necessary to
help the patient develop coping skills and improve his quality of life.
Summary
•Acute stroke is a medical emergency which needs immediate attention
and treatment. Identify the signs and symptoms of acute stroke by FAST.
Obtain a history regarding stroke in the past or a recent TIA. Identify
the risk factors of stroke. Confirm the diagnosis of stroke by signs and
symptoms, and exclude other stroke mimics like hypoxia, hypoglycemia,
or hypotension. On suspicion of stroke, immediately hospitalize the patient
and get a CT scan done to differentiate between an ischemic and
hemorhhagic stroke.
•Post-stroke involves care for a patient who has had a stroke recently
which includes comprehensive neurorehabilitation, prevention of
complications, and medical treatment (antiplatelet, anticoagulants for
ischemic and antihypertensive for hemorrhagic stroke and medicines to
control other risk factors).
•Stroke prevention involves measures to prevent a first or recurrent
stroke. This includes compliance to medical management and
neurorehabilitation. Also, control of high risk factors is of utmost
importance (lifestyle changes, diet, exercise, weight control,  antidiabetic
and anticholesterol medications).

21. Migraine
Migraine is a complex disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of headache,
most often unilateral and in some cases associated with visual or sensory symptoms.It
is severe paroxysmal headache which is throbbing in nature preceded by an aura.
It may be associated with nausea and vomiting.Migraine can be precipitated by red
wine,menses,hunger,insomnia,perfumes.Symptoms accompanying migraine may be
photophobia,scalp tenderness,paraesthesias,vertigo,syncope,seizures, etc.
Signs and symptoms
Throbbing or pulsatile headache, with moderate to severe pain that intensifies with
movement or physical activity
Headache lasts 4-72 hours. Also the patient is sensitive to light and sound
Unilateral and localized pain in the frontotemporal and ocular area, but the pain may
be felt anywhere around the head or neck
Pain builds up over a period of 1-2 hours, progressing posteriorly and becoming
diffuse
Nausea and vomiting, including anorexia and food intolerance, and light-headedness
Features of migraine aura may precede or accompany the headache phase or may
occur in isolation. Usually develops over 5-20 minutes and lasts less than 60 minutes.
Most commonly visual but can be sensory, motor, or any combination of these
Visual symptoms may be positive or negative
Examination
•
Cranial/cervical muscle tenderness
•
Horner's syndrome (ie, relative miosis with 1-2 mm of ptosis on the same side
as the headache)
•
Tachycardia or bradycardia
•
Hypertension or hypotension
•
Hemisensory or hemiparetic neurologic deficits (ie, complicated migraine)
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
144
•
Pupils may be poor in light reactivity, with near dissociation from light
Diagnosis
The diagnosis can be made on patient's history. International Headache Society
diagnostic criteria are that patients must have had at least 5 headache attacks that
lasted 4-72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated) and that the headache must
have had at least 2 of the following characteristics.
•
Unilateral location
•
Pulsating quality
•
Moderate or severe pain intensity
•
Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (eg, walking
or climbing stairs)
•
In addition, during the headache the patient must have had at least 1 of the
following:
•
Nausea and/or vomiting
•
Photophobia and phonophobia
The most common positive visual phenomenon is the scintillating scotoma, an arc or
band of absent vision with a shimmering or glittering zigzag border.
Investigations
1) MRI
Neuroimaging is indicated in cases of:
•
Worst severe headache
•
Change in the pattern of previous migraine
•
Abnormal neurologic examination
•
Onset of migraine after age 50 years
•
New onset of headache in an immunocompromised patient (eg, one with cancer
or HIV infection)
•
Headache with fever
•
Migraine and epilepsy
•
New daily, persistent headache
•
Escalation of headache frequency/intensity in the absence of medication overuse
headache
•
Posteriorly located headaches (especially in children, but also in adults)
2) CT (Is done when MRI is not available or is contraindicated)
Management
145
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Management of migraine involves treatment of acute attack and prevention of
recurrence.
Treatment of acute attack
Hospital admission for migraine is indicated for:
•
Treatment of severe nausea, vomiting, and subsequent dehydration
•
Treatment of status migrainosus
•
Detoxification from overuse of combination analgesics, ergots, or opioids
Simple analgesics alone or in combination with other drugs are beneficial in cases of
mild to moderately severe headaches. Acute treatment is most effective when given
within 15 minutes of pain onset.
Analgesics used in migraine include acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and narcotic analgesics
(eg, oxycodone, morphine sulfate).
 (5-HT1) agonists (triptans) or opioid analgesics are used, for more severe pain, either
alone or in combination with dopamine antagonists (eg, prochlorperazine).
Some commonly used triptans: Sumatriptan, Rizatriptan, Zolmitriptan, Naratriptan,
Almotriptan, Eletriptan, Fovatriptan
All the triptans are most effective when taken early during a migraine. They may be
repeated in 2 hours as needed, with a maximum of 2 doses daily. Triptans should not
be taken by patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, as they may
increase risk of myocardial ischemia, infarction, or other cardiac or cerebrovascular
events. Do not administer vasoconstrictors - ergots or triptans, to patients with known
complicated migraine.
(The drugs with dosages are explained in detail in Section E and a quick reference in
Section A [Chapter 1])
Antiemetics (eg, chlorperazine, promethazine) are used to treat vomiting associated
with acute migraine attacks. Intravenous prochlorperazine can be given in patients
with severe nausea and vomiting at the onset of an attack. Adequate hydration should
be maintained.
Prophylactic migraine therapy: It is indicated if -
•
Frequency of migraine attacks is greater than 2 /month
•
Duration of each attack is longer than 24 hours
•
The headaches cause significant disability that lasts 3 or more days
•
Abortive therapy fails or is overused
•
Symptomatic medications are contraindicated or ineffective
•
Use of abortive medications more than twice a week
•
Migraine variants such as hemiplegic migraine pose risk of permanent neurologic
injury
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
146
The goals of preventive therapy are to reduce attack frequency, severity, and/or
duration, improve responsiveness to acute attacks and reduce disability
An immediate neurologist referral should be made in case of status migrainosus,
complicated migraine or if there is no response to previous treatment.
Prevention of migraine attacks
Reduction of Migraine Triggers: Patients should avoid factors that precipitate a
migraine attack (eg, lack of sleep, fatigue, stress, certain foods, use of vasodilators).
Patients may need to discontinue any medications that exacerbate their headaches. If
an oral contraceptive is suspected to be a trigger, the patient should be advised to
modify, change, or discontinue.
Biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and relaxation therapy are also beneficial
for migraine headaches.
Summary
Migraine is a very common form of headache. It is important to
differentiate migraine from other serious headaches. Migraine can be
triggered by various factors which should be identified. Investigations
are not usually required unless other causes are suspected or patient is
not responding to treatment. Management of migraine consists of treating
the acute attack, and patient education to reduce further attacks. In
unresponsive cases or status migrainosus or complicated migraine,
neurologist referral needs to be sought.

22. Spondylosis
Spondylosis is a spinal degeneration of the discs or spinal joints and is universally
present in all people above 50 years. However in some cases it becomes severely
symptomatic and requires investigations and treatment accordingly.
Degenerative changes in the vertebrae may occur at cervical or lumbar level with
subsequent impingement of neural elements in the canal.
There are 2 types of spondylosis: cervical and lumbar spondylosis
When to Suspect Spondylosis
Cervical
1)
Neck pain radiating to arms (1 or both),the pain is almost always on the outer
aspect of the arm(cardiac pain is almost always at the inner aspect of the arm)
2)
Restricted neck movements-loss of neck extension & lateral flexion
3)
Scapular pain may or may not be associated with neck pain
4)
Tingling & numbness of upper limb (1 or both)
5)
Dizziness or vertigo or tinnitus or blurring of vision - these symptoms are
exacerbated by extremes of movement or minor neck jerk in case of cervical
spondylosis.
6)
Arm weakness with pain
Examination
1)
Tenderness of posterior neck region, scapular muscles & trapezius, biceps,
pectoralis major, and triceps
2)
Reduction in or loss of sensation of touch, prick or hypersensitiveness in the
area of distribution of cervical segments
3)
decreased power in upper or lower limb, poor grip, difficulty in raising arms
against resistance, difiiculty raising legs against resistance,foot drop.
4)
Brisk reflexes-biceps,triceps, brachioradialis & sometimes in lower limb,knee
jerk & ankle jerk
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
148
5)
Babinski sign positive
6)
Imbalance on Romberg's test positive on eyes closed only (when eyes are open
patient has good balance)
Lumbar Spondylosis
1)
Gait disturbance
2)
low back pain, radiating pain from back to thighs
3)
Sciatica
5)
tingling & numbness of lower limb only
6)
weakness in lower limb only
7)
bladder or bowel - difficulty in control or incontinence in case of lumbar
spondylosis
Examination
Tenderness of lumbar & paraspinal muscles, sacro-iliac region,
Straight leg raise test (SLR) -positive
Reduced power in lower limb
Brisk lower limb reflexes, Babinski-absent,
sensory deficit in lower limb
bowel bladder incontinence
restricted back movemen - ,bending, extending & lateral movements
Warning Signs
1)
Neck pain or low back pain with weakness in upper limb or lower limb
(neurodeficit)
2)
Sensory loss in cervical or lumbar segment innervation
3)
Severe imbalance with nausea, vomiting associated with neck pain
4)
Severe blackout associated with neck pain
5)
Severe back pain with restricted movements
6)
bowel bladder incontinence
IF ABOVE WARNING SIGNS ARE PRESENT DO IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION
THAT IS MRI OF CERVICAL SPINE OR LUMBAR SPINE & URGENT REFERENCE
TO NEUROLOGIST OR NEURSURGEON
1)
MRI of cervical / lumbar spine with whole spine screening. MRI is the preferred
& diagnostic imaging technique for spondylosis.
Findings may show either posterior osteophytes compressing the cord or the
149
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
2)
X ray cervical / lumbar spine
This is a basic investigation which will show loss of cervical lordosis, osteophytes
reduction in joint space or spur formation, etc.
3)
CT spine
CT spine to be done only if MRI is not available
4)
EMG/NCV
EMG and nerve study is done if above warning signs are present. It is also done
if the MRI findings are not conclusive. The study shows the level of nerve root
compression. It will confirm the diagnosis and rule out other differential
diagnoses.
5)
Blood routine -Blood tests are done to rule out infection & to check kidney &
liver function, so that appropriate medication or side effect of any analgesic
medicines can be monitored.
If Creatinine levels are high, then NSAIDS are to be avoided & other pain
medications are prescribed.
nerve roots, disc prolapse compressing the cord and reduced canal size (canal
stenosis).
MRI will show the presence of disc pathology & severity. I t depicts cord changes,
enlargement, compression, or atrophy.
This investigation will guide to make decision about management choices,
conservative or surgical.

spondylosis
Fig. 22.2: X-Ray of Lumbar spondylosis
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
150
Management
A.
Conservative Management:
1.
Medication
A)
Analgesics - Acetaminophin, NSAIDS like
Tb (diclofenac 50+paracetamol 500) 1-0-1,
Or Tb (ibuprofen 400mg +paracetamol 325mg) 1-0-1
Tb (naproxen 250mg +domperidone 10mg) 1-0-1,
If creatinine at higher side give Tb Tramadol 100 mg 1-0-1
If the pain is neuropathic in nature, then Amitriptyline or Pregabalin or
Gabapentin should be prescribed. (Dosages mentioned in Section E)
B)
Muscle relaxants-chloroxoazone(250/500mg 3-4 times a day),
methocarbomol (1.5 g four times a day in divided doses)
C)
Sedative- Sedatives like Tb Alprazolam 0.25mg or Tb Amitriptyline 25 mg
can be give in the night before bed .
2.
Cervical (neck) support collar
3.
Rehabilitation-Physiotherapy: gentle exercises, passive manipulation techniques
4.
Avoidance of lifting heavy weights
5.
Yoga under supervision
6.
Traction may be considered in severe cases.
B. Surgery
If no relief with the above mentioned then surgery is considered. Also, if there are
signs of cord compression, surgery
should be considered early and
neurosurgery referral should be
done immediately. Options are
anterior or posterior fusion of spinal
vertebrae and decompression only
or decompression along with
stabilization.
Anterior approach: This is the most
preferred one now days.
Indications:
1.
Single level disc protrusion
2.
Anterior cord compression
Procedure: Is done under general
151
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
anesthesia. A transverse 4 to 5 cm incision is made in the neck. The disk is removed
along with the posterior osteophytes and the cord is decompressed. The empty space
is filled either with a bone graft from the iliac bone or a titanium cage. Some cases
require additional fixation with plates and screws.
Result and complications: Majority of patients report an immediate relief of symptoms
after the surgery. Complications are rare and include displacement of the graft and
neurological deterioration of power in all or some of the limbs.
Post op: Patient can start walking within one to two days of surgery (with a collar
on). Patient can resume normal work after three weeks. The collar has to be worn for
three to six months.
Posterior Approach: This involves doing a laminectomy, in which the spinal process
and lamina on either side are removed.
Indications: Done in cases of cervical canal stenosis.
In this operation the spinal cord is decompressed. Post operatively the patient has to
wear a collar for three to six months.
Results and complications: It is a safe procedure if done with correct indications. If
not done properly it can cause severe neurological complications such as weakness of
all four limbs.
Summary:
Spondylosis is a degenerative condition of the spine, observed commonly
in the age group of 40 years and above. Most of the cases are treated
conservatively, however if the patient does not show any sign of relief
with the conservative management, surgery should be considered. Also,
if any warning signs of cord compression are suspected, patient should
be hospitalized and immediate MRI is warranted along with neurosurgery
consultation.
Sample Prescription For Spondylosis

23. Brain Tumors
Brain tumors are broadly classified into two types.
Benign Tumors: grow slowly and are curable, once totally excised surgically.
•
Meningiomas: are very vascular tumors that can grow to a very large size.
Fig  23.1 CT Scan of a Meningioma
•
Acoustic Neuromas: arise from the 8th cranial nerve, in the angle between the
cerebellum and pons, so are called CP angle tumors. They are slow growing and
present with one sided hearing loss with tinnitus, along with difficulty in
walking, headache, giddiness. In most of the patients the hearing loss is
permanent. Patients present with decrease hearing in one ear along with tinnitus.
At this stage the tumor is very small, can be removed easily. If not diagnosed
early, it grows very large in size. Hence should be diagnosed early by doing a
CTscan and a MRI scan.
•
Pituitary tumors: arise from the pituitary gland and are slow growing. They
initially cause hormonal and then visual symptoms. In women an early
manifestation is ammenhorea or galactorhea. In men, it may present with
153
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
thickened face and jaw bones, along with visual disturbances with restriction of
the field of vision i.e. they can see only what is straight ahead and not on the
sides (bitemporal hemianopia). Gradually they present with headaches and other
signs of raised intracranial pressure. Hence early diagnosis is very essential as
larger the tumor the more difficult it gets to excise it completely.
Tumors can be divided into primary tumors that started within the brain and those
that spread from somewhere else i.e. brain metastasis.
Malignant tumors: grow very rapidly and hence a complete cure is difficult, since
they recur after surgery and other treatments. The symptoms may include headaches,
seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is
classically worst in the morning and goes away with vomiting indicating raised
intracranial pressure. Other symptoms may be difficulty in walking, speaking and
altered sensorium.The most common malignant brain tumors are called gliomas or
astrocytomas. They have 4 grades i.e. 1 to 4. Grades 1 and 2 are slow growing and
have a relatively good prognosis. Grades 3 and 4 are fast growing and have a poor
prognosis. Grade 4 astrocytomas are also called glioblastomamultiforme, these are
the most malignant tumors of the brain. The average survival of the patients with
grade 1 and 2 is 5 Years and that of grade 3 and 4 is 10 - 12 months.
Brain Metastasis
The most common brain tumor in older people is metastasis from another malignancy.
After the lungs and the liver the brain is the most common site for malignancy.
Fig 23.2 Acromegaly in pituitary tumours
Normal hand
Acromegalic hand
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
154
Malignancy can be single or multiple, can be detected early as well as late. The
symptoms are headache, severe and generalized with one sided limb weakness.
Note: Headache in any known case of malignancy should always be taken seriously
and an urgent CT scan or MRI should be requested. Single large metastasis causing
pressure effects on the brain need surgical excision. Small multiple metastases are
treated with radiation and chemotherapy.
Investigations: Urgent CT scan of the brain (contrast and plain) or MRI brain.
Reference: Urgent reference to a neurosurgeon.
Treatment:
All brain tumor patients should be admitted once diagnosed.
Anticonvulsants(Eptoin 100 mg iv 8 hrly), antioedema measures (mannitol 100 mg iv
8 hrly with dexamethasone 4 mg iv 6 hrly)
Surgery:
Craniotomy: open surgery with attempt to totally excise the tumor. Done for all
benign tumor as well as all large malignant tumors that are causing severe brain
compression and increase of the intracranial pressure. Done under general anaesthesia,
multiple holes are drilled in the skull using an electric drilling system. The bone
between these holes is cut and removed (measuring 6 cm to 12 cm in size).Then the
dura lining the brain is cut. Surface tumors are visible at this point and are removed.
For deep tumors we have to delicately go through normal brain to reach the tumor.
The use of advanced modern operating microscopes and sophisticated tumor removal
devices such as CUSA (Cavitory ultrasonic suction aspiration) has made brain tumor
removal very safe and satisfactory.
Stereotactic biopsy: with this the skull is not opened completely but with a small
hole a needle is put in the brain and a biopsy is done. To do this a frame has to be put
on the head and the patient is taken to the CT scan or the MRI Scan. Where the
coordinates are obtained as to where the tumor is. These are then set on the frame to
get accurate biopsy. It is done under local anaesthesia and only two to three days
hospitalization is required with less of complications and patient discomfort. It is
indicated and deep seated or small malignant tumors or infected lesions such as
suspected tuberculomas. Overall the procedure is cost effective.
Endoscopic Surgery: Pituitary tumors can be removed from the nose with an
endoscope. It is a stitchless surgery which takes care of the patient comfort and
safety. Tumors within the ventricles can also be easily removed with a neuro
endoscope.
Adjuvant Therapy:
Benign brain tumors require no adjuvant therapy however malignant tumors may
require, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is given over six
155
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
weeks (5 times a week). Chemotherapy is given for grade 3 and grade 4 malignant
tumors. Presently 2 regimes are commonly used PCV and Temozolamide. PCV's to
be given in an injectable form and has side effects, but is cheaper. Temozolamide is
the preferred one which is available as tablets and has much less side effects but is
expensive. In selected types of tumors radiosurgery can be done using the gamma
knife or X-knife. This is a one-time treatment with focused radiation. The advantage
is absence of any side effects but the limitations are that it works only in selected
indications, in only certain size tumors and is very expensive.
Follow Up:
All Brain tumors patients need to be on anti convulsant medications regularly (One
year to lifelong)
Since possibilities of recurrence are high family physicians should take all symptoms
of these patients seriously.
If any doubt get a CT Scan or an MRI done and refer back to neurosurgeon.
Counseling and rehabilitation are important to the patients.
Summary
•
Brain tumours can be either benign or malignant.
•
Most common tumours are gliomas in adults
•
Second most common are meningiomas
•
Common symptoms are headache, vomiting and seizures
•
Diagnosed by CT scan or MRI scan
•
Management is generally surgery followed by chemotherapy or
radiotherapy

A head injury is any trauma that leads to injury of the scalp, skull, or brain. These
injuries can range from a minor bump on the skull to a very serious brain injury. The
most common cause of which are vehicular accident, falls, assaults, etc.
Head injury can be classified as either closed or penetrating. In a closed head injury,
the head sustains a blunt force by striking against an object. A concussion is a type of
closed head injury that involves the brain.
In a penetrating head injury, an object breaks through the skull and enters the brain.
(This object is usually moving at a high speed like a windshield or another part of a
motor vehicle)
Symptoms
The signs of a head injury can occur immediately or develop slowly over a few hours.
Even if the skull is not fractured, the brain can bang against the inside of the skull
and be bruised. (This is called a concussion.) The head may look fine, but complications
could result from bleeding inside the skull.
Fig 24.1: Depressed fracture of the skull
157
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Fig .2 Linear Fracture of the skull
•
Linear Fracture of the skull:The most common sites of linear fractures involve
the temporal and parietal bones. If the auditory meatus is injured in a
temporo-pareital fracture, the patient may have hearing loss, tinnitus or
even vertigo.
•
Fracture of the skull base: This is rare and if present may result in injury to
the cranial nerves.
When a person who just had a head injury comes to you, try to find out what happened.
Try to take the full history from the patient or the person accompanying him. In any
serious head trauma, always assume the spinal cord is also injured.
Serious head injury
The following symptoms suggest a more serious head injury that requires emergency
medical treatment:
1.
Loss of consciousness, confusion, or drowsiness
2.
Low breathing rate or drop in blood pressure
3.
Convulsions
4.
Fracture in the skull or face: Usually the break occurs at the site of impact. Skull
fractures are generally linear or depressed. Typically, if the skull is fractured,
the underlying brain has been injured. Fracture of the skull vault may be linear
or depressed
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
158
•
Open Fracture (with scalp defect): If the dura is torn the brain is often
injured as well. Moreover, if the dura has been torn the patient becomes
vulnerable to infection, particularly if pieces of hair or other debris enter, it
may give rise to a host of symptoms including the possible development of
meningitis
•
Closed Fractures (No Scalp Defect)
5.
Facial bruising, swelling at the site of the injury, or scalp wound
6.
Discharge from nose, mouth, or ears (may be clear or bloody):If the cribriform
plate is damaged, itmay result in a laceration of the meninges leading to
cerebrospinal fluidleak into the nose. The only symptom may be a continually
"running nose". This may eventually lead to meningitis and therefore has to be
treated in emergency.
7.
Severe headache: This may occur due to intracranial haemorrhage.
8.
Initial improvement followed by worsening symptoms
9.
Irritability (especially in children), personality changes, or unusual behavior
10.
Restlessness, clumsiness, lack of coordination
11.
Slurred speech or blurred vision
12.
Inability to move one or more limbs
13.
Stiff neck or vomiting - signs of meningeal irritation.
14.
Pupil changes: size is unequal or one of the pupils is not reacting.
15.
Inability to hear, see, taste, or smell
Investigations:
CT scan should be done and should be admitted immediately or shifted to another
hospital.
Fig 24.3: CT Scan Brain after a head injury
159
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Treatment:
1.
If you suspect a skull fracture, do not apply direct pressure to the bleeding site,
and do not remove any debris from the wound. Cover the wound with sterile
gauze dressing.
a.
Linear Fracture: No Surgical treatment required, analgesics, needs 24 hours
observations admission.
b.
Depressed Fractures: Have to be operated and surgically evaluated, anti
convulsants to be started. These patients have high chances of post injury
epilepsy.
c.
Fractures of Cranial Base: Require hospitalization, to be treated with high
antibiotics as there might be the case of CSF leak and meningitis.
2.
Management of CLW's: Even if the patient is referred to another hospital, it is
always advisable to suture the CLW of the scalp. If patient is not shifted to
another hospital then start with broad spectrum antibiotics and continue till
suture removal. That is after 10 days.
Reference: refer the patient urgently to a neurosurgeon.
For a moderate to severe head injury, take the following steps:
•
Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin rescue
breathing and CPR.
•
If the person's breathing and heart rate are normal but the person is unconscious,
treat as if there is a spinal injury. Stabilize the head and neck by placing your
hands on both sides of the person's head, keeping the head in line with the spine
and preventing movement.
•
Stop any bleeding by firmly pressing a clean cloth on the wound. If the injury is
serious, be careful not to move the person's head. If blood soaks through the
cloth, DO NOT REMOVE it. Place another cloth over the first one.
For a mild head injury, no specific treatment may be needed. Advice to, closely
watch the patient for any concerning symptoms over the next 24 hours.
Patient's relatives should watch for -
•
Vomiting
•
Headache not relieved after a few hours
•
Drowsiness
•
Irritability
•
Seizure
•
Unusual or confused behaviour
•
Bleeding or discharge from the ear or nose
•
Weakness or numbness in arm or leg
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
160
•
Altered vision
The symptoms of a serious head injury can be delayed. While the person is sleeping,
wake him or her every 2 to 3 hours and ask simple questions to check alertness, such
as "What is your name?"
Treatment: Analgesics may be used for a mild headache. Do not advice aspirin, because
it can increase the risk of bleeding.
Brain Hemorrhage
Can be classified as three types that is
a.
Extradural: Extradural hematomas are often secondary to a skull fracture and
tear of the meningeal arteries below the site of primary impact.
b.
Subdural: Subdural haemorrhagedevelops immediately at the time of injury, or
slowly thus causing symptoms few days after the original head injury also.
c.
Intracerebral: They are uncommon after a head injury except in case of gunshots
or penetrating injuries.
In most cases a patient will lose consciousness for a little interval. He may seem lucid
on waking up but then as the hematoma develops begins to increasingly complain of
headache, irritability, confusion. If these haematomasare large and are causing increase
in the ICP they have to be removed surgically by craniotomy.
Hematomas are potentially life threatening and can cause extensive brain injury,
including coma, and even death. This is due to the effects of compression and raised
ICP.Because of the compression the brain will press the varioustentorial compartments,
or even be forced down into the foramen magnum at the base of the skull
(herniation)thus compressing the brainstem, which can lead to death.
Usually the oculomotor nerve becomes compressed resulting in pupillary dilation,
and loss of eye movement. As the brainstem gets compressed, patient begins to
experience rapid changes in conscious-awareness, becomes stuporous, and may
become comatose with irregular respiration. It may result inhemiplegia or decerebrate
rigidity (i.e. extension of the extremities).
Brain Injury
These are further two types contusions that occur in the outer part of the brain and
diffuse axonal injury that occur in the central part of the Brain. These require ICU
management with ventilator support for upto 48 hours, and are treated medically
with
a.
Mannitol 100cc  IV 8 hrly
b.
Dexamethasone  4 mg IV 6 hrly
c.
Eptoin 100 mg IV 8 hrly
161
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Brain Death
Occurs when the brain is irreversibility damaged. These patients can be declared
dead for the purpose of organ transplantation. The clinical signs of Brain death are:
a.
Deep unconsciousness
b.
Fully dilated and non-reacting pupils.
c.
Absent doll's eye movements
d.
No motor response, to deep central pain.
e.
No spontaneous respiration.
Summary
Priority should be given to immediate assessment and stabilizing airway
breathing and circulation.
Look out for signs and symptoms that suggest immediate hospitalization
is required.
If sending the patient home, give a list of warning signs to the care taker,
so that the patient can be brought back to the doctor immediately. See
management of neurological emergencies for acute head injury
management.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
162
25. Spine injury
Spinal injury is a devastating event that occurs suddenly and whose consequences
range from minimal symptomatic pain to a tragic quadriplegia (total paralysis of all
four limbs). The key element in management is prevention of secondary neurological
damage occurring during transportation, so whenever a family physician sees a patient
with suspected spinal injury the first thing to be done is immobilize the spine which
is done with cervical color and belts for thoracic and lumbar spine.
Fig 25.1 Immobilization of Spine
Classification :
1.
Region wise:
a.
Cranio - Vertebral junction
b.
Cervical
c.
Thoracic
d.
Lumbar
2.
Type:
a.
Fracture
b.
Dislocation

3.
Complete / Incomplete
In complete spinal cord injury the entire cross section of the spinal cord has been
injured resulting in loss of all sensory & motor function below the level of injury
In incomplete spinal cord injury the spinal cord has been partially injured
preventing some communication between brain & spinal cord below the level of
injury. There is some preservation of either motor or sensory function
4.
Cause of injury
The spinal cord can be injured by transection, distraction, compression, bruising,
haemorrhage or ischaemia of the cord or by injury to blood vessels supplying it.
These injuries can all result in permanent cord injury and may be complete or
incomplete.
5.
Concussion of the spinal cord can result in temporary loss of function for hours
to weeks
Cause of spinal cord injury
Injury results from primary & secondary insults
Primary injury occurs at the time of the traumatic insult
Secondary injury occurs over hours to days as a result of a complex inflammatory
process, vascular changes and intracellular calcium changes leading to oedema
and ischemia of the spinal cord. Irreversible damage occurs to nerve cells leading
to permanent disability
Symptoms of an acute spinal injury are-
•
Flaccid paralysis below level of injury
•
Loss of spinal reflexes below level of injury
•
Loss of sensation (pain, touch, proprioception, temperature) below level of injury
•
Loss of sweating below level of injury
•
Loss of sphincter tone and bowel & bladder dysfunction
Investigations:
1.
Plain X-rays - AP and Lateral views
2.
MRI - best diagnostic tool for spinal injury, as it shows the exact damage to the
spinal cord nerves and help in deciding whether surgery is required along with
what type of surgery to be done.
Note that CT scan is not useful diagnostic tool, since structures cannot be visualized
and should be done only if MRI is not available.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
164
In order to confirm the level of injury, neurological assessment is required
•
Assess the sensory level
•
Assess the motor function
•
After 72 hours, use the ASIA guidelines -
ASIA Scale:
A = Complete No motor or sensory function (for definitions, see note below) is
preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5
B = Incomplete :  Sensory but not motor function is preserved below the neurological
level and includes the sacral segments S4-S5
C = Incomplete : Motor function is preserved below the neurological level, and more
than half of key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade of less
than 3
D = Incomplete : Motor function is preserved below the neurological level, and at
least half of the key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade of 3 or
more
E = Normal : Motor and sensory function are normal.
Treatment:
1.
At the site of accident / clinic of the family physician :
a.
Patient should be immobilized with the help of sand bags, plastic IV bottles
along the neck/head and should be fastened to the stretcher.
Fig 25.2 Burst fracture spine X-ray
Fig 25.3 Burst fracture spine MRI
165
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
b.
Airway, breathing should be assessed and maintained. Regurgitation and
aspiration should be managed accordingly.
c.
Patient should be transported with no spinal movements and care should
be taken while doing so, three persons should help in shifting / lifting the
patient, they should lift the patient from the same side only.
d.
For family physicians having to manage in their clinics due to transportation
problem 2gm of Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) in 200 ml of
normal saline should be given over a period of 1/2 hr .
2.
In the hospital :
a.
Resuscitation and maintaining the airway with intubation / ventilation if
required.
b.
Hemodynamic state is maintained.
c.
Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) -Should be started within 3
hrs. of the injury and should be continued for next 24 hrs. If started within
3-8 hrs of injury then it should be given for 48 hrs. MPSS is given as a
loading bolus dose of 30 mg/kg over ½ hr and a maintenance dose of 5.4
mg/kg/hr for the required period accordingly.
d.
In dislocation patients traction needs to be applied by the neurosurgeon.
e.
If patient has no evidence of spinal cord compression on MRI and shows
improvement on MPSS and traction then there is no need for the surgery.
However in patients with spinal cord compression or progressive
neurological deterioration surgery must be considered.
f.
Physiotherapy - is given for rehabilitation.
3.
Surgery : Basic aims of surgery are decompression of the neural elements,
reduction of misalignment and restoration of spinal stability.
a.
Anterior /Posterior
b.
Decompression / Stabilization
4.
Operative procedure in spinal injury:
a.
Cranio - Vertebral junction :
i.
Anterior surgery - Trans oral excision of odontoid
ii.
Posterior surgery - Cranio cervical decompression and or stabilization.
b.
Cervical spine :
i.
Anterior Corpectomy /Disc excision with anterior stabilization.
ii.
Posterior Decompressive Laminectomy
c.
Thoracic spine :
i.
Trans thoracic Anterior Corpectomy with screws and rods/plate
fixation.
ii.
Posterior Decompressive Laminectomy and stabilization using pedicular
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
166
screws and rods /plate fixation.
d.
Lumbar spine :
i.
Trans abdominal Anterior Corpectomy.
ii.
Posterior Decompressive Laminectomy and stabilization using pedicular
screws and rods /plate fixation.
Many patients require both anterior as well as posterior surgery so it is done as
a single and a two stage procedure.
5.
Recent Advances: Availability and development of stem cell therapy is slowly
revolutionizing the management of spinal cord injury. All the surgeries listed
above are focused on the musculo skeletal system and none of them correct the
neurological injury. The central nervous system (CNS) i.e. the brain and the
spinal cord is the only tissue in the body which is incapable of degeneration,
therefore any damage to CNS is irreversible. However with availability of the
stem cells this is now no longer valid. Despite the surgery many patients are left
with neurological deficits and are given rehabilitation in form of physiotherapy.
The main aim of rehabilitation is to get the patient back to activities of daily
living and achieve maximum possible degree of functional independence,
therefore when stem cells are implanted to damage spinal cord they help to
reestablish broken connections and thereby help in return the loss neurological
functions.
Complications to watch for
•
Pressure sores
Patients who have a spinal cord injury are at high risk of damage to their skin.
The spinal cord injury causes loss of sensation of pain, pressure & temperature.
They also have lost motor control and have poor autonomic nervous system
function. Pressure mattress should be used for such patients
Air mattress should not be used for unstable spines. Change position 2 hourly
of the patient.
•
Pneumonia
Regular ches physiotherapy and assisted coughing will help the patient.
•
Urinary tract infections
Long term management includes clean intermittentcatheterisation; condom
drainage suprapubic catheter. Reduce bladder spasm by prescribing anti-
cholinergics.Watch for recurrent UTI, renal & bladder calculi by maintaining
good hydration and good hygiene of theperineal area to reduce infection.
•
Constipation
Increased fluid and fibre in diet.
167
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
•
Deep venous thrombosis
Thromboprophylaxis to be carried out so that DVT is averted.
Summary
Patients with spinal cord injury usually have distressing neurologic deficits
and disability. Priority should be given to immediate assessment and
stabilizing airway breathing and circulation. Patients with suspected spinal
cord injury should be given a collar and transported on a hard back
board. Watch out for hypotension, neurogenic shock and breathing in
spinal cord injury patients. Patients with spinal cord injury should receive
a comprehensive program of physical and occupational therapy as a part
of management.

26. Dementia and
Alzheimer's Disease
Definition:
Dementia is defined as an impairment in memory and atleast one other cognitive
domain that is sufficiently severe to impair social and occupational functioning.
What are the early signs of dementia?
•
Forgetfulness-forgets name & context
•
Language & communication problem-difficulty to find correct words while
speaking
•
Personality hanges-agitated, anxious, apathetic, depressed, irritable,
suspicious
•
difficulty in performing familiar tasks
•
confusion & disorientation
•
odd behavior
•
difficulty in following strong lines
What is MMSE
Mini mental state examination is a sensitive reliable 30 questionnaire that is used in
clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is also used to
estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the
course of cognitive changes in an individual over time & makes it an effective way to
document an individual's response to the treatment given.
What are the types of dementia?
1)
Mild Cognitive Impairment(MCI)
This is a condition which involves mild cognitive impairment, but is not significant
to interfere with the daily activities.
169
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between the expected
cognitive decline of normal aging and the more serious decline of dementia. It
involves problems with memory, language, thinking and judgment that are
greater than normal age-related changes. More than the patient, the family and
friends will notice the memory lapses. But, it is not very evident as the patient
continues to do the daily activities routinely.
On MMSE score 25 to 28
Investigations:
MRI shows bilateral hippocampal atrophy
Management:
Conservative management:
a)
Treat the associated conditions that can also affect the memory. For eg.
Treat hypertension or depression or sleep disturbances if present.
b)
Start neuroprotective vitamins. For eg. Vit B12, folic acid, CoQ10, omega3
fatty acids
c)
Start cognitive rehabilitation. Refer to a psychologist for specialized
rehabilitation. Studies have shown computer use, playing games, reading
books and other intellectual activities may help preserve function and prevent
cognitive decline.
d)
Regular physical exercise may also help prevent or slow cognitive decline.
e)
Dietary advice: A diet low in fat and rich in fruits and vegetables
f)
Social engagement may help to preserve mental function and slow mental
decline.
2)
Alzheimers Disease
Alzheimers is a condition of behavior and cognitive impairment which interferes
with social and occupational functioning. It is a progressive brain disease which
is irreversible in nature. This is characterized by development of amyloid plaques
and neurofibrillary tangles,these plaques are seen on hippocampus(a structure
which helps to encode memory) also the plaques are seen on other areas of
cerebral cortex which helps in thinking and making decisions
Signs and symptoms:
The most prominent feature is memory impairment for recent events,language
dysfunction,apraxia,behavioral disturbance.
MMSE- 12 TO 24
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians

Etiology
-family history, advancing age, vascular factors, inflammatory markers, APOE
4 genotype, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, downs syndrome,
traumatic brain injury.
Prognosis
Patients with alzheimers can display with anxiety, agitation, depression, insomnia,
paranoia.Patients with alzheimers requires assistance for their ADLS that is for
dressing, bathing, toileting they may also have symptoms of dyphagia and they may
require the feeding tube to be inserted also they may have difficulty in walking.

Investigations:
•
MRI - medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) and parietal atrophy, bilateral
hippocampal atrophy,eventual atrophy in temporal,parietal,and frontal cortex.
•
mild atrophy: opening of sulci
•
moderate atrophy: volume loss of gyri
•
severe (end-stage) atrophy: 'knife blade' atrophy.
PET CT brain:- FDG-PET can show hypometabolism in the temporoparietal regions
and/or the posterior cingulum, or the hippocampus.
This may help differentiate AD from FTD, which shows frontal hypometabolism on
FDG-PET.
CT: CT should be done only if MRI is contraindicated (for eg. Presence of metallic
implants)
Management of Alzheimers Disease
Pharmacology
1)
Cholinesterase inhibitors
Tablet Donepezil to give 1 tablet of 5 mg at bedtime may increase to 10 mg in 4
to 6 weeks for mild to moderate disease
Tablet Galantamine extended release start 8 mg every morning with food may
increase 16 mg after 4 weeks
Tablet Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day may increase to  3 mg twice a day after
2 weeks
2)
NMDA receptor antagonist
Memantine start with tablet 5mg daily at weekly intervals to maximum 20 mg/
day doses greater than 5 mg should be divided in bid.

3)
Vascular Dementia
This is also called as multi-infarct dementia,and this occurs because the blood
supply to the brain is affected typically  due to a series of minor strokes.Here
the features of cognitive decline is associated with atleast one cerebral infarct
which is temporary in nature.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
174
Investigations:
Radiological findings may show one or more cerebral infarcts of varying sizes,or
severe diffuse white matter abnormalities
•
MRI may show global atrophy, diffuse white matter lesions, lacunes and 'strategic
infarcts' (infarcts in regions that are involved in cognitive function).
•
PET CT: Hypometabolism in the areas of infarct
•
CT: Multiple lacunar infarcts
Management of vascular dementia

Dementia With Lewy Bodies (DLB)
This is a type of dementia closely associated with parkinsons disease,this is
characetrised by presence of lewy bodies which are clumps of alpha-synuclein &
ubiquitin proteins in neurons.
Features like Impaired attention,concentration are seen,whereas visuospatial
functioning,memory and naming is preserved.Parkinsonism,fluctuations and
visual hallucinations are highly suggestive of DLB.
MMSE 15 to 28

5)
Frontotemporal Dementia
This is a type of dementia where the frontotemporal area of brain is affected.
175
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
It may be associated with motor neuron disease.
Prominent features are personality/behavioural change,apathy or language
dysfunction.
MMSE score-30 in initial 3 years

Summary
The major types of dementia are Alzheimer's, vascular, FTD and DLB.
The clinical history, examination remain the mainstay of diagnosis. MRI
and PET CT scans' findings are used to confirm the diagnosis and
differentiate between the various types of dementia. Treatment of
dementia needs a multidisciplinary approach which includes medications,
rehabilitation, neuroprotection, environmental modifications and
caregiver education.

27. Movement Disorders
Movement disorders are the disorders which affect fluency, speed, quality, and ease
of movements. Abnormal fluency or speed of movement is called dyskinesia. It may
involve excessive or involuntary movements known as hyperkinesias; or slowed or
absent voluntary movements known as hypokinesia.
Common Types of Movement Disorders
–
Tremors
–
Parkinson's
–
Tics
–
Dystonia
–
Chorea
–
Ataxia
–
Restless leg syndrome
1)
Tremors
Tremors could occur at rest or are intentional (on performing activity).
If they are at rest it could be-
a)
Essential tremors - these are also called as benign tremors & are aggravated
on activity. In old patients they are called senile tremors.
b)
Secondary tremors - these occur due to anxiety, alcohol, hyperthyroidism ,
secondary to medications (eg-salbutamol, amytryptilin), etc
c)
Parkinson's tremors- these are resting pill rolling tremors reduced with
activity & sleep &may be associated with other features of Parkinson's such
as bradykinesia (slow movement) and rigidity (stiffness).
d)
Intentional tremors - These tremors are absent at rest & present only on
doing activity. They may be associated with other cerebellar signs.
Management of Essential Tremors
1)
Assure the patient that the tremors are benign
2)
Propanalol 10-40 mg twice a day
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
178
3)
Neuracetam 400 mg 1 tablet tds
4)
B complex 1 daily
5)
Rehabilitation: physiotherapy and Occupational therapy
If the above treatment is not responding then give gabapentin, alprazolam or
clozapine
If medications are unable to suppress the tremors then consider referring the
patient to neurologist or neurosurgeon for further management.
2)
Parkinson's Disorder
Parkinson's is a degenerative disorder of the nervous system involving
degeneration of dopamine generating cells. In the early stages of Parkinson's
disease, the face may show little or no expression or the arms may not swing on
walking. The speech may become soft or slurred. Symptoms worsen as the
condition progresses over time.
Although Parkinson's disease cannot be cured, medications may markedly
improve the symptoms.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms are related to movement disorders like shaking, rigidity, difficulty
walking.
Resting pill rolling tremors
Bradykinesia-slow handwriting, slow shuffling gait, slow daily activity, slow
speech
Rigidity-lead pipe type (stiffness throughout flexion,extension of the elbow)or
cogwheel type (intermittent)
Associated
Gait-no arm,swing,mass turning,freezing episode, slow shuffling gait,short steps
Mask faces-decreased expression on the face
Leaning posture
Blapharospasm or decreased blinking
Dementia
Investigations
Blood tests may be done to check for abnormal thyroid hormone levels or liver
damage. An imaging test (such as a CT scan or an MRI) may be used to check for
signs of a stroke or brain tumor.
PET CT sometimes may detect low levels of dopamine in the brain, a key feature
of Parkinson's.

Risk factors for Parkinson's
Age : Young adults rarely experience Parkinson's disease. It ordinarily begins in
middle or late life, and the risk increases with age. People usually develop the disease
around age 60 or older.
Sex: Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than are women
Heredity: Having a close relative with Parkinson's disease increases the chances of
developing the disease.
Exposure to toxins: Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may be a risk
factor of Parkinson's.
Management
Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease can be divided into symptomatic and
neuroprotective (disease modifying) therapy.
A)
Symptomatic treatment
1)
Levodopa, coupled with carbidopa, remains the gold standard of symptomatic
treatment for Parkinson disease. Carbidopa allows for greater levodopa
distribution into the central nervous system. The time when medication is
providing benefit for bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor is called "on" time, and
the time when medication is not providing benefit is called "off" time.
For details regarding Levodopa and Carbidopa dosage refer to Section E.
Levodopa provides the greatest benefits for motor signs and symptoms, with
only few adverse effects. However, its long-term use is associated with the
development of motor fluctuations ("wearing-off") and dyskinesias.
Dopamine agonists (ropinirole, pramipexole) provide moderate symptomatic
benefit and delay the development of dyskinesia compared with levodopa.
Levodopa in combination with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor is started at a
low dose and slowly titrated to control clinical symptoms. Most patients
experience a good response on a daily levodopa dosage of 300-600 mg/day
(usually divided 3 or 4 times daily) for 3-5 years or longer.
Anticholinergic agents are used when tremors are not adequately controlled
with dopaminergic medication. However, they have limited efficacy and may
cause neuropsychiatric side effects.
One of the most commonly used anticholinergic is trihexyphenidyl. The initial
dose of trihexyphenidyl should be low and gradually increased. It is
recommended to begin therapy with a single 1-mg dose. Dosage can be titrated
by 1 mg each week or so, until a total of 4-6 mg is given daily or until satisfactory
control is achieved. Some patients may require higher doses. Benztropine
(Cogentin) is also commonly used, with an initial dose of 0.5-1 mg daily at
181
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
bedtime. Dose can be titrated at weekly intervals in increments of 0.5 mg to a
maximum of 6 mg/day.
Amantadine is an antiviral agent that has antiparkinsonian activity. Amantadine
offers additional benefit in patients experiencing waxing or waning effects from
levodopa.
Amantadine is commonly introduced at a dose of 100 mg per day and slowly
increased to an initial maintenance dose of 100 mg 2 or 3 times daily. Potential
side effects of amantadine are confusion and hallucinations.
Possible strategies for advanced stage or when the response time for levodopa
is decreasing include the following:
•
Adding a dopamine agonist, COMT inhibitor, or MAO-B inhibitor
•
Dosing levodopa more frequently
•
Increasing the levodopa dose
•
Switching from immediate release to sustained release levodopa/carbidopa/
entacapone
Surgical treatment includes deep brain stimulation and neuroablative surgeries. This
may be an option for advanced stages. A neurosurgeon referral is thus required for
uncontrolled advanced cases.
Rehabilitation - A comprehensive neurorehabilitation consisting of physiotherapy,
occupational therapy, and psychological counseling is required.
B)
Neuroprotective therapy aims to slow down or reverse the disease progression.
This includes CoQ 10 and multivitamin prescription. For details refer Section E.
3)
TICS
Rapid repetitive involuntary contractions of a group of muscles are known as
tics.
They are of two types-
Motor tics (involving bodily movement)such as facial twitching, grimacing,
binking& shrugging the shoulders.
Phonic or vocal tics (involving sounds)such as coughing,grunting,clearing the
throat &sniffing
Causes
Anxiety,stress,excitement,fatigue,medications, other diseases like CP
Treatment
a)
Habit reversal therapy-this therapy concentrates on other movements which
compete with the tic movement.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
182
b)
Exposure with response prevention-this teaches techniques to suppress unpleasant
feelings proceeding a tic.
In severe cases where day to day life is affected a new surgical treatment option
of deep brain stimulation can be discussed by a neurosurgeon.
4)
Dystonia
This is a syndrome of involuntary sustained or spasmodic muscle spasm &the
movements are slow, sustained & often occur in a repetitive & patterned manner
but are unpredictable & fluctuant. There may be abnormal posturing & twisting.
Causes-dystonia occurs due to
–
damage to basal ganglia
–
infection,stroke,drug interactions, CP,brain trauma.
Common types are writers cramp,cervical dystonia or torticollis,tardive dystonia-
due to medication
Treatment
1)
Medicine-Pacitane,levodopa,syndopa,clonazepam,lorazepam,baclofen
2)
Sensorytrick-Control the movement by touching or stimulating affected or
nearby body part.
3)
Rehabilitation-Occupational and physical therapies
Stress management
In severe cases deep brain stimulation (Refer to a neurosurgeon)
5)
Chorea
Excessive, spontaneous, irregular, non repetitive, random movements of arms
or legs with unstable (dance like gait) are called chorea.
Causes
Levodopa induced Huntington's disease, Wilson's disease, and Sydenham's
chorea-in acute rheumatic fever
Investigations
TSH & PTH, serum copper & ceruloplasmin level, serum ammonia, anti streptococcal
antibody titers.
MRI brain, PET CT brain.
Treatment
1)
Neuroleptics-Fluphenazine, risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine & quetiapine
Or
2)
Gaba ergic -gabapentin& valproate & clonazepam.
183
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
3)
CoQ 10
6)
Ataxias
Common types of ataxia:
cerebellar ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia, Friedreichs ataxia, ataxia teleangectesis,
ataxia with vit E deficiency.
Invetigations :
Basic routine blood tests-TSH,VIT E levels,Co Q 10 levels,vit B 12 levels, metabolic
screening.
MRI brain, PET CT brain
Genetic testing
Treatment-
vit E, Co Q 10, B complex
Multivitamin (treat the specific cause)
Propanalol or primadone,clonazepam,baclofen for spasticity,amantadine,
acetazolamide for episodic ataxia.
Treat any underlying secondary cause if present.
Rehabilitation : Occupational and physical therapy
7)
Restless Leg Syndrome
This is a neurological movement disorder of the limbs which is associated with
a sleep complaint. Patient has irresistible urge to move legs.
Signs and symptoms :
An urge to move the legs that occurs due to uncomfortable and unpleasant
sensations in the legs which may worsen during periods of rest or inactivity and
worsens in evening & at night. This urge is partially relieved by movement.
These symptoms are not attributed to any mental disorder.
Other features associated with RLS are sleeplessness,daytime fatigue,involuntary
repetitive jerky movements either during sleep or while awake or at rest.
Diagnosis:
The patients of RLS should be tested for iron deficiency anemia.
If any secondary cause is suspected on the basis of initial history, abnormal
neurological findings, other laboratory tests which include CBC, creatinine,
fasting blood glucose, magnesium, TSH, vit b12, folate should be done.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
184
EMG, NCV should be considered if suspected for polyneuropathy or
radiculopathy
Management
Pharmacology
Medications for primary RLS can be given on the basis of the symptoms. In case of
secondary RLS Dopaminergic agents, benzodiazepines, opiods, anticonvulsants are
to be given accordingly
Non Pharmacology
To avoid caffenine,alcohol,nicotine
Sleep hygiene measure
Medications which exacerbate RLS such as like Serotonin reuptake inhibitors,dopamine
antagonists should be discontinued if possible.
Physical modalities before bedtime such as hot or colds water bath.
Summary
One of the common movement disorder is Parkinson's disorder. It is
caused by dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons. It is important to
distinguish between Parkinson's tremors from benign tremors as the
management will differ. Family physician plays a key role in
multidisciplinary treatment of Parkinson's. Monitor for dose response
and side effects of medications. CT or MRI may be normal in early stages
of Parkinson's. Therefore, if there is suspicion of Parkinson's , referral to
a neurologist is required.
Ataxias can be very debilitating and affect the daily and social life of the
patient. They are progressive and can affect the lifespan. Rehabilitation
plays a major role and should be started at early stage.

28. Demyelinating Disorders
Demyelinating disorders are characterized by loss or dysfunction of myelin in the
central or peripheral nervous system which occurs due to damage to the myelin
sheath of neurons. This damage impairs the conduction of signals in the affected
nerves. In turn, the reduction in conduction ability causes deficiency in sensation,
movement, cognition, or other functions depending on which nerves are involved.
The most common demyelinating disorder is multiple sclerosis.
1)
CNS :
Here the demyelinating process involves the central nervous system. The cause
can be primary or secondary.
Primary
In primary demyelinating disorders, cause is unknown, but an autoimmune
mechanism is suspected, since the disorder sometimes follows a viral infection
or viral vaccination.
a)
Multiple sclerosis
b)
Neuromyelitis optica
c)
optic neuritis
d )
acute transverse myelitis
e)
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,
f)
acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis
Secondary
Demyelination is secondary to an infectious, ischemic, metabolic, or hereditary
disorder or to a toxin (eg, alcohol, ethambutol)
a)
toxins-alcohol, ethambutol
b)
infections-JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
c)
nutritional- Vit B12 deficiency, Vit E,Vit B6, Thiamine ,osmotic
demyelination syndrome.
d)
hypoxic
187
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
e)
hereditary - Adrenoleukodystrophies, metabolic storage disorders.
2)
Peripheral demyelination:
Here the demyelinating process occurs within the peripheral nervous system .The
most common type is Polyneuropathy.
When to suspect a demyelinating disorder
-
diffuse or multifocal neurological deficit
-
sudden onset,particularly in young adults
-
onset within weeks of an infection or vaccination
-
neurodeficits that wax & wane
-
symptoms suggesting a specific demyelinating disorder
Signs and symptoms
Visual--Blurred vision, unilateral loss of vision, Oscillopsia, Diplopia
Motor--Trunk/limb weakness, Spasticity, Hyperreflexia
Gait disturbance & Balance problems
Sensory-Numbness, paraesthesias, dysesthesias,trigeminal neuralgia,hyperpathia,
proprioception deficits
Cerebellar-Tremor, ataxia, incoordination
Genitourinary-urgency/frequency/retention of urine, Incontinence, constipation,
impotence, dyspareunia
Neuropsychiatric-Impairment of memory, concentration, attention, Depression,
irritability, anxiety
Other symptoms-Prominent intractable fatigue with no other cause
Here we describe the most common demyelinating disorders.
Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system
and optic nerves by causing destruction of the myelin sheaths. This is a life-long
chronic disease diagnosed primarily in young adults. During an MS attack,
inflammation occurs in areas of the white matter of the central nervous system in
random patches called plaques. This process is followed by destruction of myelin.
Myelin destruction causes nerve conduction defects.
Usually a young adult will present with diplopia or other visual disturbance, weakness
in limbs, fatigue, paraesthesia or sensory loss, incoordination, gait imbalance, bladder
and bowel dysfunction. Memory problem and speech disturbance may also be present.
These symptoms may wax and wane.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
188
Multiple sclerosis is of four types
1)
Benign multiple sclerosis
2)
Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis
3)
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis
4)
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis
Investigations
1)
MRI - MRI typically shows more than one hyperintense white matter lesions
(plaques) particularly in periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, brainstem,
cerebellum and/ or spinal cord. Ovoid lesions perpendicular to the ventricles
(Dawson's bar or fingers) may be seen. In chronic advanced stage, global cerebral
atrophy is seen.
Gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI scans may show enhancing white matter
lesion which depict acute active MS lesions.
Newer FLAIR MRI and MR spectroscopy have increased the sensitivity for
detection of MS lesions.
MRI also helps in excluding any other cause of neurological complaints.
MRI is also an efficient monitoring tool to study the progression of the disease
and also useful for treatment.
2)
CT scan - In MS CT scan may show enhanced white matter lesion but the
appearance is nonspecific. Therefore, it is used only to rule out other causes of
neurodeficit.
3)
Lumbar puncture - LP is not routinely done in MS. It is done only if the MRI
findings are non diagnostic.
CSF abnormalities found in MS include a mononuclear cell pleocytosis and an
increased level of intrathecally synthesized IgG. The total CSF protein is usually
normal or slightly elevated. Oligoclonal bands are detected in the CSF.
4)
Evoked Potentials- EP testing assesses function in afferent (visual, auditory,and
somatosensory) or efferent (motor) CNS pathways. VEP may show delay in
latencies, SSEP may show delayed latencies in posterior column conduction of
the spinal cord, the brainstem and cerebral cortex.
BAEP may show delayed auditory pathways.
5)
In Neuromyelitis optica serum antibodies aquaporin 4 may be present.
Treatment
Goals of therapy
1)
Minimizing the effect of acute attack
189
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
An exacerbation of MS is the appearance of the new neurologic deficit or
reappearance and/or worsening of an old deficit due to MS that lasts longer
than 24 hours and is not due to fever or other systemic process.
Methylprednisolone- IV 1g for 5 days followed by tapered oral prednisolone
for acute attacks
2)
Modify the course of the disease (to prevent the relapse)
Interferon is given nowadays to modify the disease progression.
Interferons are listed below
a)
Interferon Beta-1b
Dose-8 MIU (250mcg) to be given subcutaneously on alternate days
Side effects-Flu like symptoms may be seen, elevated liver enzymes can be
seen.Leukopenia and psychiatric symptoms can be seen.
b)
Interferon Beta-1a
Dose- 6 MIU (30 mcg) to be given intramuscularly weekly.
Side effects-Flu like symptoms can be seen
c)
Glatiramer acetate
Dose- 20 mcg to be given subcutaneously daily
Side effect-mild injection site reaction may occur,transient flushing,chest
tightness,shortness of breath.
3)
Symptomatic management
a)
Bladder dysfunction-to treat and prevent incontinence and urinary
retention,hyperreflexic bladder(urgency,frequency,urge incontinence) it is
better to keep a cathether after taking advice of a urologist.
Tb Oxybutynin 5 mg thrice a day, Tb Tolterodine (long acting) 2mg once a
day
b)
Spasticity
Simple exercises should be tried for example stretching,riding a bicycle.
When physical measures fail, start on tb baclofen,tizanidine,benzodiazepines
c)
Constipation-Stool softner or laxatives for example lactulose, bisacodyl
d)
Fatigue -Multivitamins ,rehabilitation,dietary advice
e)
Depression or emotional lability- Amitryptiline 25 mg qhs
f)
Musculoskeletal pain - NSAIDs .
g)
Paraesthesia-Carbamazepine 100-200 mg once or twice a day.
4)
long term rehabilitation including visual rehabilitation is important
Transverse myelitis
Transverse myelitis is a sudden onset of acute inflammation of the spinal cord. This
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
190
inflammation damages nerve fibers, and causes them to lose their myelin coating,
thereby leading to decreased electrical conductivity in the spinal cord.
Causes
The disease is presumed to be caused by viral infections, spinal cord injuries, immune
reactions, schistosomiasis or insufficient blood flow through spinal cord vessels.
This condition may be associated with
Bacterial Infections - Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Lyme borreliosis, syphilis (tabes
dorsalis), tuberculosis
Viral Infections - herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus,
enteroviruses (poliomyelitis, Coxsackie virus, echovirus), human T-cell, leukemia virus,
human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, rabies
Post-Vaccination - Rabies, cowpox
Paraneoplastic syndromes
Vascular - thrombosis of spinal arteries, vasculitis secondary to heroin abuse, spinal
arteriovenous malformations
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms typically develop over the course of hours or days and may progress over
weeks. There is sudden onset of weakness and numbness of the limbs along with
bladder bowel incontinence or dysfunction. Patient experiences pain and there may
be associated fever. Typically, the patient suddenly falls down due to paralysis in
both lower limbs.
Sensory symptoms of transverse myelitis may include a sensation of pins and needles
traveling up from the feet. Back pain can occur at the level of the inflamed segment of
the spinal cord. The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of
the involvement of the various sensory tracts, but there is often a sensory level.
Motor weakness occurs due to involvement of the pyramidal tracts and mainly affects
the muscles that flex the legs and extend the arms. Involvement of the autonomic
nervous system is common and frequently leads to impaired function of the bladder
and bowel and can also lead to episodes of high blood pressure. Bladder paralysis
often occurs and urinary retention is an early manifestation.
Examination
If all the four limbs are involved this means the upper cervical cord is involved. And
also there is risk of respiratory paralysis (segments C3, 4, 5 to the abdominal
diaphragm).
A lesion of the thoracic spinal cord (T1-12) will produce upper motor neuron signs in
the lower limbs, presenting as a spastic diplegia.
191
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
A lesion of the lower part of the spinal cord (L1-S5) often produces a combination of
upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs.
Differential diagnosis
Acute spinal cord trauma, Lyme disease, acute compressive lesions of the spinal cord
such as epidural metastatic tumour and infarction of the spinal cord (eg. due to
insufficiency of the anterior spinal artery).
Investigation
1)
MRI Spinal cord-The T1 weighted images show decreased signal intensity and
myelomalacia in chronic stage.MRI is preferred as it is diagnostic. It also shows
the severity and extent of spinal cord involvement.
2)
If MRI is not available CT SCAN is done to rule out any compression of spinal
cord by abscess or tumor.
Management
Stabilise the patient after checking the vitals
If you suspect tranverse myelitis then neurophysician consultation is required
immediately.
1)
ABC Airway breathing Circulation
Start O2, IV fluids, and shift the patient to nearby hospital.
2)
In hospital management
Methylprednisolone - IV 1g for 5 days followed by tapered oral prednisolone
for acute attacks or Dexamethasone is used as an acute line of treatment
3)
Plasma exchange is used for moderate or severe cases who do not improve with
IV steroids.
4)
If any infective cause is found it is treated with Antibiotics and in case of herpes
zoster treatment should be with acyclovir.
In chronic patients of demyelinating diseases long term care is required.
1)
Pulmonary care-Patient should be ventilated properly if the saturation is low,
also aspiration precaution needs to be taken care.
2)
Bedsore prophylaxis needs to be taken care.
3)
Urinary rehabilitation in consultation with a urologist.
4)
Comprehensive neurorehabilitation should be started at the earliest.
Polyneuropathy
The demyelination of peripheral nerves leads to polyneuropathy. Polyneuropathy

Fig.28.2:  MRI of transverse myelitis
193
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
may affect primarily motor fibres or primarily sensory fibres or it may be mixed
(sensory & motor).
Causes
Toxic - Alcohol, lead toxicity
Infections - Lyme disease, Diphtheria, leprosy, AIDS
Diabetes
Cancer
Medications - Colchicine, ethambutol, chloroquine, amiodarone.
Vasculitis
Signs and symptoms
One should suspect polyneuropathy when a patient has diffuse or multifocal sensory
deficit, weakness without hyperreflexia. If the findings are diffuse but had
asymmetrical onset, then it may suggest multiple mononeuropathy.
The patient may have distal symmetric stocking-glove distribution of loss of sensation.
Acute neuropathies suggest an autoimmune cause,a toxin,infection or a postinfectious
cause
Symmetric distal neuropathies suggests toxic or metabolic
Rash, skin ulcers, and Raynaud's syndrome with polyneuropathy suggest vasculitis.
Weight loss,lymphadenopathy, with polyneuropathy suggests paraneoplastic
syndrome.
Investigations
EMG/NCV is a diagnostic tool which gives information about the sensory and motor
fibres.
Blood tests- CBC, Electrolytes, Renal profile, Blood sugar, VIT B12,Folate levels,TSH.
Coagulation studies,ProteinC & S, antithrombin III,anticardiolipin antibody and
homocystine levels if one suspects vasculitits or hypercoagulable state as a cause of
polyneuropathy.
Urine toxicology for heavy metal.
Treatment
1)
For neuropathy amitryptiline 25 mg once a day or gabapentin 100 mg tds
2)
Rehabilitation - Physiotherapy & Occupational therapy can minimize the disability
and pain .
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
194
3)
Treat the underlying cause - Remove the toxins, correct the nutritional deficiency
4)
Vitamin B12, folic acid can be given for neuroprotection.
5)
Corticosteroids for acute polyneuropathy.
Summary
The common demyelinating disorders include multiple sclerosis,
transverse myelitis and peripheral polyneuropathy. Multiple sclerosis is
a progressive disorder and eventually affects the whole body rendering
the patient bed ridden. Recent advances in disease modifying agents
have somewhat improved the prognosis. MRI of the brain and spine is
diagnostic and can be used as a monitoring tool. A multidisciplinary team
of specialists from the field of medicine, surgery, rehabilitation and
nursing would be required. Family physician serves as an important link
between the patient and the members of this team.

29. Infections of CNS
Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) can be viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic
in origin. Infectious microorganisms most often enter the CNS by direct penetration
after trauma or by travelling in the bloodstream.
The common types of infections involving the CNS are described below
1)
Meningitis
2)
Encephalitis
3)
Brain abscess
4)
Cerebral malaria
1)
MENINGITIS
The protective membranes covering the brain and the spinal cord are called
meninges. Infection of the meninges is called meningitis. The infection may occur
due to bacteria, virus, fungus or protozoa.
They are classified according to the cause which has been described below.
Causes
1)
Bacterial -a) pyogenic & b) tuberculous
2)
Viral
3)
Fungal
4)
Protozoal
Bacterial meningitis
The most common bacteria that cause meningitis is S. pneumoniae and
N.meningitidis.They initially colonize the nasopharynx by attaching to nasopharyngeal
epithelial cells. Once in the bloodstream, the blood borne bacteria can reach the
intraventricular choroid plexus, directly infect choroid plexus epithelial cells, and
gain access to the CSF.
Signs & Symptoms
The classic triad of bacterial meningitis consists of the following:
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
196
•
Fever
•
Headache
•
Neck stiffness
Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, sleepiness, confusion,
irritability, delirium, and coma.
Risk Factors
Otits media, immunocompromised, trauma, exposure to drugs,recurrent
meningoencephalitis or meningitis,history of recent resection of acoustic neuroma,
recent injection into subarachnoid space.
Tuberculous Meningitis
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) develops in 2 steps. Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli
enter the host by droplet inhalation. Localized infection escalates within the lungs,
with dissemination to the regional lymph nodes. In persons who develop TBM, bacilli
seed in to the meninges or brain parenchyma.
The second step in the development of TBM is an increase in size of a Rich focus until
it ruptures into the subarachnoid space. The location of the expanding tubercle (ie,
Rich focus) determines the type of CNS involvement
This can also occur after a primary infection in childhood or as a part of miliary
tuberculosis.
Unlike bacterial meningitis Tuberculous meningitis in adults does not develop acutely
from hematogenous spread of tuberculous bacilli to the meninges. Rather, millet seed-
size (miliary) tubercles form in the parenchyma of the brain during hematogenous
dissemination of tubercle bacilli in the course of primary infection. These tubercles
enlarge and are usually caseating. The propensity for a caseous lesion to produce
meningitis is determined by its proximity to the subarachnoid space and the rate at
which fibrous encapsulation develops. Subependymal caseous foci cause meningitis
via discharge of bacilli and tuberculous antigens into the subarachnoid space.
Signs & Symptoms
TBM may have an acute presentation. Sometimes it may present with cranial nerve
deficits, or it may have a more indolent course involving headache, meningismus,
and altered mental status. The prodrome is usually nonspecific; including headache,
vomiting, photophobia, and fever also symptoms such as lassitude, depression,
papilloedema, occulomotor palsies can also be seen.
Viral meningitis
Viral meningitis is inflammation of the meninges as a manifestation of central nervous
system (CNS) infection. Viral meningitis is also often referred to as aseptic meningitis.
In uncomplicated viral meningitis, the clinical course is usually self-limited, with
197
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
complete recovery in 7-10 days. However, when the viral pathogen causes
meningoencephalitis or meningomyelitis, the course can be significantly more
protracted.
Based only on clinical symptoms, viral meningitis cannot be differentiated from
bacterial meningitis. Both appear as headache, fever, and neck stiffness but viral
meningitis has no evidence of bacterial presence in CSF. However, viral meningitis is
less serious than bacterial meningitis. Therefore, CSF analysis is needed to identify
the disease. In general, there are no medications to fight the virus that cause meningitis,
so treatment is usually aimed at relieving the patient's symptoms by having rest and
fever-reducing medication.(IV Acyclovir may be used in few cases.)
Investigations of Meningitis
1)
CSF Finding is one of the most important tests which helps us in diagnosing the
cause and type of meningitis
CSF findings-
a)
Pyogenic - presence of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytosis, decreased
glucose concentration, increased protein concentration, increased opening
pressure.
 b)
Tubercolous- increased CSF pressure, it is usually clear but if allowed to
stand may form a clot, AFB seen on staining
c)
Viral-Typical profile is lymphocytic pleocytosis, a normal or slightly elevated
protein concentration, organisms are not seen on gram or AFB stain.
d)
Fungal-the CSF findings are similar to tuberculous with culture positive for
fungal infection

2)
CT scan
The CTscan may show Watershed and lacunar infarcts and may show cerebral
oedema in patient with bacterial meningitis, also it may show subdural effusion.
Contrast-enhanced CT scans may also help in detecting complications such as
venous thrombosis, infarction, and ventriculitis. Ventriculitis is a complication
of bacterial meningitis that is seen commonly in neonates. Ependymal
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
198
enhancement can be seen on contrast-enhanced CT scans.
In case of tuberculous meningitis the scan may show hydrocephalus or may
show tuberculoma.
3)
MRI findings
MRI helps to detect the presence and extent of inflammatory changes in the
meninges as well as complications. Noncontrast MRI of patient with
uncomplicated acute bacterial meningitis may demonstrate obliterated cisterns
and the distention of the subarachnoid space with widening of the
interhemispheric fissure, cortical hyperintensities that represent edema.
In complicated cases with seizures and evolving focal signs, MRI is superior to
CT in demonstrating parenchymal lesions due to meningoencephalitis or vasculitic
complications. MRI helps in diagnosing intraventricular rupture of pyogenic
abscess.
4)
Blood tests
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential counts
Serum electrolytes
Serum glucose (which is compared with the CSF glucose)
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine and liver profile
Blood culture
Complications
•
Hypotension or shock
•
Hypoxemia
•
Hyponatremia
•
Cardiac arrhythmias and ischemia
•
Stroke
•
Exacerbation of chronic disease
Management of Bacterial Meningitis
Firstly to check the vitals & stabilize the patient,if the patient is dehydrated due to
vomiting or the BP is low start him on IV fluids immediately
If you suspect meningitis in the patient the patient has to be referred for
hospitalization.
Antibiotics
After CSF testing start on empiric antibiotics
Ceftriaxone-1-2 g BD or 12 hrly or
Cefotaxime- 1-2 g BD or 12 hrly.
199
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Vancomycin - Starts with 0.5-2 g/day maximum is till 500 mg 6 hrly
Gentamicin - starts with 3-5 mg/kg/day in divided doses
Meropenum - starts with 500 mg
Augmentin -1.2 gm
Management Of Tuberculous Meningitis
Standard therapy nowadays includes combination of Rifampicin, isoniazid and
pyrazinamide
(rifampicin 120 mg, isoniazid 50 mg and pyrazinamide 300 mg: <40 kg: 3 tab/day;
40-49 kg: 4 tab/day; 50-64 kg: 5 tab/day; 65 kg: 6 tab/day)
Ethambutol dosage is 15-30mg/kg.
Blood tests are to be done such as liver profiling as these medicines are hepatotoxic
in nature.Other routine blood tests should also be done like Renal function
tests,CBC,Electrolytes.
Compliance to medications is necessary in these conditions.
Also see post infection chronic care at the end of this chapter.
Encephalitis
Encephalitis means infection of the brain parenchyma .The causes are similar to
meningitis.Encephalitis presents as diffuse or focal neuropsychological dysfunction.
Sign & Symptoms
Fever,confusion,behavior abnormality,altered level of consciousness,evidence of either
focal or diffuse neurological symptoms, Neck pain, stiffness, photophobia, lethargy,
flaccid paralysis .
Acute confusion or amnestic states.
Patients may also have hallucination,agitation,personality changes,behavior
change,focal or generalized seizures may also occur.
Investigations
1)
Blood tests-Complete blood count (CBC),Serum electrolyte levels,Serum glucose
level,Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels
2)
Urine electrolyte levels,Urine or serum toxicology screening
Blood cultures for bacterial pathogens
3)
Lumbar puncture-A lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed in all cases of
suspected viral encephalitis.
Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid reveals increased amounts of protein
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
200
and white blood cells with normal glucose, though in a significant percentage of
patients, the cerebrospinal fluid may be normal.
Bleeding is also uncommon except in patients with herpes simplex type 1
encephalitis.
4)
CT SCAN
CT scan without contrast reveals marked hypodensity representing edema within
the frontal and temporal lobes with sparing of the basal ganglia and cerebellum.
The findings are typical of herpes encephalitis.
5)
MRI scan
MRI offers better resolution in patients with herpes simplex encephalitis.
Characteristic MRI findings in viral encephalitis - FLAIR sequence shows bilateral
thalamic, globus pallidus and caudate involvement, bilateral midbrain
involvement
6)
EEG- electroencephalograph may show sharp waves in one or both of the
temporal lobes.
Management
To refer the patient to neurology department for hospitalization
Specific treatment to be started according to the cause
Supportive management-Stabilize the patient by checking the vitals like blood pressure,
SPO2,pulse,HGT and accordingly giving O2,IV fluids ,antihypertensives and immediate
shifting of the patient for hospitalization.
IV acyclovir dose-
Adult: 10 mg/kg every 8 hr for 10 days.
Child: 3 months: 20 mg/kg every 8 hr for 10 days
Also see post infection chronic care at the end of this chapter.
Brain Abscess
Brain abscesses are uncommon, serious, life-threatening infections. Brain abscess is
Focal suppurative lesion in brain parenchyma.
Brain abscesses can originate from infection of contiguous structures (eg, otitis media,
dental infection, mastoiditis, sinusitis) secondary to hematogenous spread from a
remote site (especially in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease), after skull
trauma or surgery
Signs & Symptoms
The clinical presentation depends upon its location.
201
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
More than an infectious process this presents as expanding intracranial lesion.It presents
with headache which is of dull, constant character either hemicranial or generalized
and is progressive in nature.Headache may be associated with nausea and projectile
vomiting .
There may be focal or generalized seizure,focal neurological deficit including
hemiparesis,aphasia or visual field defects.
Signs of raised intracranial pressure may be seen-Change in mental state and
Papilloedema.
Investigations
1)
MRI
MRI scan in an abscess patient will show a mass effect with surrounding edema.
Gadolinium-enhanced coronal T1-weighted MRI in a patient also shows the
midline shift by the abscess.
On T1 contrast-enhanced MRI the abscess may be seen as an irregular mass with
moderate peripheral enhancement.
2)
CT scan
Brain abscess will appear as an ill-defined hypodensity on non-contrast CT scan.
They are frequently ring-enhanced with the addition of intravenous contrast.
The CT scan will show the cerebral oedema and also it will show the thickness
of cerebral abscess wall.
3)
Lumbar puncture-LP should not be performed in patients with known or
suspected intracranial infections,since it increases the risk of herniation.
4)
Blood profile- Complete blood count, Serum electrolytes
Serum glucose, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine and liver profile.
Management
Treatment involves high dose parenteral antibiotics & neurosurgical drainage.
Third generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime & ceftriaxone are being
used.Meropenum & vancomycin are also being used.
Dosages- Cefotaxime- 1-2 g 4-12 hrly
Vancomycin - Starts with 0.5-2 g/day maximum is till 500 mg 6 hrly
Gentamicin - starts with 3-5 mg/kg/day in divided doses
Meropenum - starts with 500 mg
Augmentin -1.2 gms

Cerebral Malaria
Cerebral malaria refers to a life threatening infection of the cerebrum caused by
protozoa plasmodium falciparum.
The earliest manifestation is nonspecific fever. Loss of appetite, vomiting and cough
are common. The history of symptoms preceding coma may be as brief as one to two
days.
The primary symptoms which are seen in Cerebral Malaria are:
(a)
Impaired consciousness with non-specific fever.
(b)
Generalised convulsion and neurological sequelae and
(c)
Coma, initially arousable which becomes unarousable later.
Cerebral malaria manifests as diffuse symmetric encephalopathy accompanied by
focal neurologic signs. Some passive resistance to head flexion may be detected.
Examination
In cerebral malaria the tendon reflexes are variable, and the plantar reflexes may be
flexor or extensor; the abdominal reflexes are absent. Flexor or extensor posturing
may be documented.Patients are seen to have retinal hemorrhages with pupillary
dilatation.
Funduscopic abnormalities include discrete spots of retinal opacification, papilledema,
cotton wool spots, and decolorization of a retinal vessel or segment of vessel
(occasional cases).
Convulsions may be generalized and often repeated, commonly seen in children.
History and clinical findings of convulsion, coma and altered sensorium are important.
Investigations
1)
Blood tests -These include CBC,creatinine,Liver profile,electrolyte,bleeding time
clotting time,PT,INR,BUN, also blood tests for malarial parasite,malarial
antigen,blood culture.
2)
Peripheral smear: Asexual form of P. falciparum is seen in peripheral blood smear,
in thick and thin blood smear films stained by Giemsa stain. In some patients
with prior antimalarial treatment or sequestration of parasitized RBCs in cerebral
circulation, peripheral smear may not show any parasites. In such a situation,
atleast 3 smears 6 h apart should be examined. At least 3 smears should be
negative before excluding cerebral malaria.
3)
The rapid diagnostic test (antigen detection test) and PCR may be helpful.
4)
CSF examination is necessary to exclude other causes of febrile encephalopathy.
CSF is generally normal in cerebral malaria, however, mild pleocytosis (10-50
cells/mm3) and protein rise up to 200 mg/dL may be seen.
203
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
5)
CT and MRI are usually normal or show edema and cortical or subcortical infarcts
in watershed zone in 15%-20% patients.
6)
EEG shows nonspecific abnormalities, such as diffuse slowing, spike wave
discharges, and burst suppression pattern.
Management
Cerebral malaria is a serious condition. If cerebral malaria is suspected admit the
patient in a hospital immediately. Stabilize the patient and transfer the patient to a
hospital.
In hospital management
1)
Antimalarial therapy
2)
Fluids and nutrition
3)
Treatment of seizures
4)
Respiratory status
5)
Anaemia
6)
Coagulopathy
Following are the dosages of antimalarials-
1)
IV Chloroquine - initial dose 10mg/kg over a period of not less than 8 hours,
preferable by slow intravenous infusion, Subsequent infusions of 5mg/kg should
be administered every 8 hours until a total dose of 25mg/kg is given.
2)
Artemether- adults and children over 6 months 3.2 mg/kg as a loading dose by
Intrmuscular injection, followed by 1.6 mg/kg daily until the patient is able to
tolerate oral medications for a maximum of 7 days.
3)
Artesunate- A loading dose of 2mg/kg should be followed by 1mg/kg after 4
hours and 24 hours,thereafter a dose of 1mg/kg should be given daily until the
patient is able to tolerate oral medications for a maximum of 7 days.
IV quinine is also used but it is associated with lot of side effects.
Supportive & Adjunctive Therapy:
•
Comatose patient should be given meticulous nursing care.
•
A Nasogastric tube should be inserted to aspirate the stomach contents
•
Urethral catheter to be inserted and attached to a urobag which will measure
output
Fluid intake and output chart should be maintained.
Level of coma should be monitored along with temperature, respiratory rate
and depth, blood pressure and vital signs.
•
Antipyretics - Paracetamol is effective in reducing fever.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
204
•
Anticonvulsants - It is crucial to control or prevent seizure, as they can cause
neural damage and are associated with a fatal outcome. A slow Intravenous
dose of 0.15mg /kg of Diazepam is effective in controlling convulsion and it can
be repeated if required.
•
Reduction of Intracranial Pressure - Raised ICP can cause death by transtentorial
herniation or by compromising cerebral blood flow. Mannitol is used to reduce
cerebral edema.
•
Correction of Hypoglycaemia - This can be done by using hypertonic glucose.
•
Anemia should be treated with blood transfusion.
•
Acidosis - Correction of anaemia, dehydration and control of seizures reduces
acidosis.
•
Thrombocytopenia needs to be monitored and corrected.
Exchange transfusion is justified when parasitemia exceeds 10% of circulating
RBCs.
Microcirculatory Flow - Pentoxifylline reduces red cell deformability, blood
viscosity, systemic vascular resistance and platelet aggregation which improve
microcirculatory flow.
•
Desferroxamine - An iron chelator which reduces formation of reactive oxygen
by reducing amount of free iron.
Post Infection Chronic Care
1)
Tuberculosis- To monitor whether the patient is taking his medications regularly
especially the AKT.
2)
Compliance & monitoring for side effects is an important task of the physician
3)
Improve the nutrition-which includes High protein diet with dietary advice is
very important. Also multivitamins should be given as it may give extra nutrition
which may be skipped from diet.
4)
Rehabilitation- Physical and occupational therapy to improve weakness.
5)
Post surgical care in case of surgery for eg- In Case of abscess, the wound needs
to be checked for pus.
In bed ridden patients skin care, DVT prophylaxis needs to be monitored to prevent
DVT, bedsores, also the ryle's tube,catheter tracheostomy care needs to be taken
care of.
205

Summary
CNS infections are serious conditions which require hospitalization. Early
diagnosis and treatment will prevent complications. The common CNS
infections encountered are meningitis, abscess and cerebral malaria.
Tuberculous meningitis needs long term treatment. Therefore, compliance
to treatment needs to be monitored.

30. Neuromuscular Disorders
The brain controls the movements of skeletal (voluntary) muscles via specialised
nerves. The combination of the nervous system and muscles, working together to
permit movement, is known as the neuromuscular system. There are many separate
diseases that are classified as neuromuscular disorders.
Some of the major diseases affecting the neuromuscular system are classified into
three groups:
A.
Disorders affecting primarily the muscles
1.
Muscular dystrophies
2.
Inflammatory myopathies
3.
Toxic myopathy
B.
Disorders affecting primarily the nerves
1.
Motor neuron disease
2.
Spinal muscle atrophy
3.
Poliomyelitis
4.
Guillian Barre syndrome
C.
Disorders affecting primarily the neuromuscular junction
1.
Myaesthenia gravis
Muscular Dystrophies
Muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration causing
muscle weakness. Muscle degeneration occurs due to disruption of the cell wall of
muscle cell. It is caused by a genetic abnormality that leads to faulty production or
absence of the proteins essential for the structural integrity of the cell wall. Subnormal
functioning of these walls therefore makes those more prone to damage even with
forces of day to day muscle contraction. This leads to accelerated damage of the
tissue which cannot be repaired by existing cells. As the difference between number
of damaged cells and number of cells available for repair increases muscles grow
weaker and weaker.
Various investigations are recommended for the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy.
207
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Diagnosis of muscular dystrophy can be confirmed using following steps:
Diagnosis
Points to note from the history of the patient:
•
History of progressive muscle weakness in the patient
•
Weakness progressing in different regions of the body like UEs, LEs and Trunk
•
History of progressive functional deficits
•
History of consanguinity of parents
•
Strong family history
Assessment and evaluation
•
Manual muscle testing shows weakness of the muscles, the pattern of weakness
changes as per the type of muscular dystrophy
•
Tendon jerks are usually diminished or in early stage of the disease will be
normal
•
Tone of the muscles is normal however sometimes you may find hypotonia
•
Posture and gait assessment will show compensatory mechanisms like increased
lumbar lordosis, waddling and toe walking etc.
•
Easy fatigability will be observed during assessment
•
Some dyspnoea may be present depending on the involvement of cardiac and
respiratory systems
Investigations
•
Blood serum testing will show increased serum CPK levels
•
Muscle biopsy will show histopathological changes in the muscles and soft tissues
•
Electromyography - EMG shows difference in the muscle unit potentials of
dystrophic muscles. It shows features of primary muscle disease.
•
Musculoskeletal MRI -It possesses diagnostic capabilities similar to muscle biopsy
and may be preferred over EMG and Biopsy due to its non-invasive nature. It
may show muscle degeneration, necrosis and fibrosis.
•
Genetic testing - Genetic testing is the gold standard test for confirming the
type of muscular dystrophy. Patients should be encouraged to undergo genetic
testing as well as counseling.
Common types of muscular dystrophies
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Becker's Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) and
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
208
Limb Girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). The less common forms are FacioScapulo
Humeral dystrophy (FSHD), Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), Myotonic
muscular dystrophy, Occulopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular
dystrophy, Emery Dreiufuss muscular dystrophy.
1.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy : This is the most common and the most severe
type of muscular dystrophy with rapid progression of muscle weakness. This
affects young boys only. It is an X- linked recessive disorder, which results in an
absence of dystrophin. Deficiency of dystrophin leads to degeneration of the
muscle fibers with resultant muscle weakness. The first symptoms are decreased
motor skills, clumsy walking, calf pseudohypertrophy, lumbar lordosis. Hip
extensions are often the first muscle group affected.
Gower's maneuver positive - Gower's sign is when the patient makes use of his
hands to climb up on his body while getting up from the floor. Frequent falls
while walking, running or jumping, easy fatiguability, difficulty climbing stairs,
poor balance, waddling gait, toe walking, etc.
The patients gradually lose independent ambulation and are wheelchair bound
and become bedridden later, owing to the resultant spinal deformity. Symptoms
start by the age of 7 years and they become wheelchair bound by the age of 10-
12 years. Later on cardiorespiratory complications develop which lead to early
mortality by the age of 22 years.
2.
Becker muscular dystrophy: It is an X linked recessive disorder involving genetic
mutation which leads to abnormal dystrophin protein production (not completely
absent dystrophin as in DMD). The disease progresses in the same stages as
DMD. The muscle weakness, postural and structural deviations and
compensations remain identical. The functional loss is also same as observed in
DMD. However the rate of progression of the disease is much slower. The life
expectancy is much more that in DMD.
3.
Limb girdle muscular dystrophy: Limb Girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is
one of the slow progressive muscular dystrophies, where the muscles of the hip
and shoulder region are involved earlier than other muscles. Slowly the muscles
undergo thinning causing severe weakness in other parts of the body as well.
The patient has difficulty in getting up from the floor without support, climbing
up the stairs, walking, lifting arms, overhead activities and poor balance with
frequent falls.
4.
Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy: As the name suggests the disease affects the
muscles of arms, shoulder, neck and face. In the later stages of the disease other
muscles may also get involved and severely limit the function. The patient has
asymmetric facial muscle weakness (eyelid drooping, inability to whistle,
decreased facial expression), asymmetric shoulder muscle weakness, inability
to chew and swallow, speak, difficulty breathing, etc.
209
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
5.
Myotonic muscular dystrophy: The characteristic of the disease is Myotonia,
which means delayed relaxation of the muscle after voluntary action or prolonged
contraction. Along with myotonia and muscle weakness it presents with cataract,
heart conduction defects, hormonal variations and mental retardation.
6.
Congenital muscular dystrophy: It presents with muscle weakness at birth or
during infancy. Children typically appear "floppy" due to low muscle tone and
lack of spontaneous movement. Although muscle weakness can stabilize short
term, it progresses with time. This leads to rigidity of spine, contractures and
spinal deformities. In later stage respiratory complications may arise. These affect
quality of life and life span.
7.
Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy: One of the characteristic features of the
disease is involvement of the cardiovascular system by the third decade of life
leading to cardiomyopathy along with generalized muscle weakness.
Management
The management of muscular dystrophy is multidisciplinary.
Medical management:
Muscular dystrophy is medically incurable at the moment. Various medicines and
newer drugs are under investigation but none have given a conclusive finding.
Medical management aims to:
1)
Completely halt or slow down the disease progression
2)
Lengthen the period of independent walking
3)
Symptomatic improvements
4)
Functional improvements to ease activities of daily living
5)
Prevent complications of contractures and deformities
6)
Preserve cardio-respiratory functions
Gold standard medical therapy at the moment is steroid therapy
Corticosteroids and glucocorticoids are routinely used in the treatment of muscular
dystrophy. Although it is not a mainstay of treatment in India, it is integral in the
management of muscular dystrophies in western countries. However there are side
effects of steroids which must be monitored.
Side effects of steroids: Weight gain, Behavioral changes- irritability, hyperactivity,
euphoria, mood lability (mood swings), depression,Excessive hair growth,Growth

Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
210
Rehabilitative management:
Due to the progressive and incurable nature of the disease, rehabilitation is the crux
of the management of dystrophies. Clinicians must emphasize benefits of rehabilitation.
Rehabilitative management includes various disciplines like physiotherapy, aquatic
therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, Diet and nutrition and psychological
intervention. All these are equally important and the requirement may differ
depending upon how advanced the disease is.
Physiotherapy - The aim of physiotherapy treatment is to prevent secondary
musculoskeletal complications, training the muscles at a moderate intensity to slow
down the process of fibrosis and muscle degeneration, to facilitate functional
independence and to prevent secondary cardio-respiratory impairment.
Stretching and exercises are the key components of physiotherapy for muscular
dystrophy. Physiotherapists will prescribe tailored exercises to all the patients and
may prescribe assistive devices like knee and ankle braces, close contact braces to
facilitate standing, walking and prevent scoliosis.
Aquatic therapy - The aim aquatic therapy is same as that of physiotherapy but with
more emphasis on the cardio-respiratory endurance of the patients. Aquatic therapy
refers to performing exercises in the water with a trained therapist. Exercises are
tailor made according to the abilities of the patient.
Occupational Therapy - Occupational therapy aims to maintain the function of the
patients and provide assistive devices or alternate techniques for activities of daily
living and vocational activities.
Occupational therapists will also provide assistive devices that are key in improving
independence in daily activities.
Speech therapy - Patients with muscular dystrophy may present with hypertrophy
of tongue and in later stages dysarthria and dysphagia due to muscle weakness.
Speech therapists will address these impairments and prevent further complications
like aspiration and recurrent respiratory infections.
Diet and nutrition management - Due to lack of activity and sluggishness of bowel
movements children and adults with muscular dystrophy may develop nutritional
deficits and reduced intake. A proper diet and nutrition advice and timely monitoring
and assessments are therefore key in their management.
Psychological counseling - Psychological counseling is required not only for the
patients but also for the care givers. Patients develop negative emotional and
behavioral problems as the disease progresses and need to taught and made aware
of the strategies for the management of these. Some common psychological problems
are emotional sensitivity, anger management, depression, anxiety, temper tantrums
and learned helplessness. Care givers should also be made aware as to how to deal
with such problems.
211
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Surgical management :
Due to progressive muscle weakness and imbalance, children develop contractures
of the muscles, and skeletal deformities.
Surgical corrections may be required for these deformities. Surgical corrections are
mainly of three types tendon release surgeries to prevent contractures of the muscles
, bony corrections in case of fixed contracture and scoliosis prevention surgeries and
spinal fixation.
Surgical intervention is decided based on the functional improvement that the patient
will gain after surgery and the severity of secondary complications that may develop
in absence of surgical management.
Genetic Counselling:
 Once diagnosed the patients should be sent for genetic counseling, wherein the nature,
prognosis of the disease and possibilities and patterns of inheritance will be discussed
with the patient. They will also be given further information about the management
of the disease and prevention in subsequent generations.
Inflammatory Myopathy
These are autoimmune diseases in which the skeletal muscles are damaged by an
inflammatory immune mechanism.
1)
Polymyositis - Polymyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that causes
symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness; elevated skeletal muscle enzyme levels.
Myalgias, arthralgias and dysphagia may also be associated. The patient has
difficulty kneeling, climbing or descending stairs, raising arms, lifting objects,
combing hair, holding the head up. Pelvic girdle involvement is usually greater
than upper body involvement. Cardiac involvement may cause symptoms of
pericarditis or cardiomyopathy.
Signs and symptoms:
•
Fatigue
•
Anorexia
•
Morning stiffness
•
Fever (associated with antisynthetase antibodies such as anti-Jo-1)
•
eight loss
•
On examination - muscle tenderness and nodular feel on palpation
2)
Dermatomyositis - this myositis is associated with erythematous skin changes
over extensor surfaces of the joints and a facial rash. The muscle weakness is
similar to polymyositis
3)
Inclusion body myositis - this type of myositis is seen after the age of 50 years
and it involves the fingers, forearm flexors and leg extensors.Muscle biopsy
shows inflammatory infiltrates,with characteristic rimmed inclusion vacuoles &
amyloid deposits.

Investigations
•
Complete blood count (CBC) - May show leukocytosis or thrombocytosis;
leukocytosis is present in more than 50% of patients
•
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level - Elevated in 50% of
patients with polymyositis
•
Elevated muscle enzyme levels
•
Myoglobinuria
•
Autoantibodies - Antinuclear antibody assay - Positive in polymyositis; Myositis-
specific antibodies; anti-Jo-1 antibodies in polymyositis
•
Positive rheumatoid factor results
•
MRI scan: shows signal intensity abnormalities of muscle due to inflammation,
edema, or scarring.
•
Electromyography: It may show evidence of membrane irritability, increased
insertional activity, fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves at rest. The EMG
may show a typical myopathic picture - decreased amplitude and duration;
increased polyphasic potentials. Chronic changes such as evidence of denervation-
reinnervation may also be seen.
•
Muscle biopsy: It shows muscle fiber inflammation with focal endomysial
infiltration by mononuclear cells, endothelial cell damage, and increased amounts
of connective tissue. Later in the course of polymyositis it may show muscle
fiber degeneration, fibrosis, and regeneration.
Treatment
Corticosteroids
Prednisone is the first-line treatment of choice for polymyositis.
Dosage 1 mg/kg/day, either as a single or divided dose. This high dose is continued
for 4-8 weeks, until the creatine kinase level returns to normal. Taper the dose by 5-
10 mg on a monthly basis until the lowest effective dose.
Immunosuppressants
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used for the short-term treatment of steroid-
resistant cases of polymyositis.
Diet
Patients with polymyositis may benefit from a high-protein diet. Monitor patients to
avoid excessive weight gain due to corticosteroid use.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
214
Activity
Encourage patients to start an exercise program as early as possible. During the acute
stage, passive range of motion exercises and splints are given to avoid contractures.
Once acute inflammation is under control, the rehabilitation program is started.
Toxic Myopathy
Major common causes are-
1)
Steroid myopathy
2)
Statin induced myopathy
These medicines are commonly encountered by a family physician. Any patient who
is already on steroids or statins; develops muscular weakness which is non specific,
generalized, and recent onset should raise a suspicion for side effect of this medicine.
Statin should be held for few weeks and if the weakness reverses it is diagnostic. In
case of steroids, one should taper the dose in consultation with a specialist physician.
Management
If detected early and if the medications are stopped, weakness may be reversed.
Motor Neuron Disease
Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neuromuscular disease caused due to selective
degeneration of the motor neurons. The degeneration is progressively noted in the
upper motor neuron (cortex) or lower motor neurons (Medulla and anterior horn
cells) or both. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of neurons causing
progressive muscle weakness. The cause is unknown. There are various types of
MND, based on region affected, rate of progression of the disease and UMN or
LMN involvement. The prognosis of each type differs significantly.

1.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis:
ALS is the most common variant of MND. Disease manifests due to both UMN
and LMN degeneration.
Symptoms are of UMN type like progressive muscle weakness, brisk reflexes,
increased tone of the muscles, cramps, and LMN type like wasting, fasciculations,
hypotonia, severe weakness in different regions of the body. There are two
types- a) limb onset where the weakness begins in the upper limb or lower limb,
b) bulbar onset where there is difficulty in speech, swallow and breathing at the
onset.
The prognosis of this condition is the worst with life expectancy of up to 3 - 5
years from diagnosis. The weakness progresses all over the body and the patient
becomes bed ridden and will need ventilator support.
2.
Primary lateral sclerosis:
PLS is a relatively uncommon variant of MND. It manifests mainly in the form
of UMN degeneration.
The symptoms are mainly the UMN signs in limb and bulbar region but with
lesser wasting and weakness of the limbs as compared to ALS. The progression
of the disease is slower than in ALS and the prognosis and life expectancy is
more (6-7 years).
3.
Progressive bulbar palsy:
Progressive bulbar palsy is also a rare variant of MND. It is caused by
degeneration of lower motor neurons in bulbar region. It may develop into a
bulbar onset ALS.
Symptoms include dysarthria (difficulty or slurring of speech) , dysphagia
(difficulty or slowness of swallowing and chewing food), breathing difficulty,
exertion dyspnoea and orthopnoea.
4.
Progressive spinal muscular atrophy:
Progressive spinal muscular atrophy is also a rare variant of MND.
The progression is relatively slower and mainly exhibits lower motor neuron
symptoms.
Diagnosis:
Diagnosis of MND is a diagnosis of exclusion.
There are set criteria, Revised Eorld federation of neurology El-escorial criteria for
the diagnosis of Amyotrphic Lateral Sclerosis as this is the most common type of
motor neuron disease. However the other types are differentiated and diagnosed
using clinical features, physical assessment and electromyography.

ALS category
Requirements
Definite
UMN and LMN signs in 3 regions of the body
Definite Familial
UMN and LMN signs in 3 regions of the body and
confirmed genetic involvement
Probable
UMN and LMN signs in two regions of the body

Investigations
1.
Electromyography is the gold standard in the diagnosis of MND which shows
anterior horn cell involvement.
2.
MRI brain and spine screening: It helps to exclude any focal spinal or cerebral
disease. MRI report will be normal in MND.
3.
PET CT scan: It is done in patients where paraneoplastic syndrome is suspected.
It rules out presence of malignancies anywhere in the body. PET CT scan will be
normal in MND.
4.
Lumbar puncture: It is done to rule out any other causes of muscular weakness.
CSF study will be normal in MND.
5.
Blood tests: Routine and heavy metal screening. Blood tests will be normal in
MND.
6.
Genetic testing: SOD1 gene abnormality may be detected.
Management
As the disease manifests in multiple body systems over a long period of time and
affects quality of life of the patient, multidisciplinary management is the best approach.
Pharmacological management
1.
Riluzole is the only approved medicine that has shown significant effect on the
survival duration. Riluzole inhibits the glutamate release and modulates some
of the post synaptic effects of glutamate. Dosage: 50 mg bd. Side effects: nausea,
vomiting, vertigo, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, anemia. Monitoring:
Monitor hemoglobin, LFT and serum creatinine levels.
2.
Neuroprotective drugs: CoQ10, vitamin B12, Vitamins C, E, omega3 fatty acids.
For details refer to Section E.
3.
Antispastic drugs and muscle relaxants may be required for muscle spasticity
and muscle cramps. Refer to Section E for more details.
217
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Non Pharmacological management
Exercise: Regular moderate intensity physical exercise has several benefits in MND.
It prevents rapid damage to the muscles and functional deterioration. Exercise also
has an anti-inflammatory effect. Exercise also helps prolong respiratory insufficiency,
dysphagia and dysarthria.
Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for MND consists of following disciplines:
1.
Neurorehabilitation: Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech therapy,
Psychological counseling, Aquatic therapy
2.
Diet and nutrition: High protein diet is recommended. In patients where
swallowing is affected, dietitian and swallow therapist should be consulted to
modify the diet consistency, regularity, food items, etc. Some patients may
require nutritional supplements.
3.
In late stages PEG (Percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy) may be required. PEG
is a surgical technique that has shown significant effect of the survival in MND
by preventing dysphagia related complications. Refer to gastroenterologist for
PEG.
4.
Respiratory management: Artificial ventilator support in the later stages of the
disease which has significantly prolonged the survival of MND patients. Chest
physician should be involved in the care of MND patient to assess requirement
for non invasive ventilation for eg. Bipap machine, etc.
Spinal Muscle Atrophy
The spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs) comprise a group of autosomal-recessive
disorders which involve progressive weakness of the lower motor neurons.
Different types of spinal muscular atrophies have been described based on age of
onset. The most common types are acute infantile (SMA type I, or Werdnig-Hoffman
disease, present before 6 months of age), chronic infantile (SMA type II, present
between the ages of 6 and 18 months), chronic juvenile (SMA type III or Kugelberg-
Welander disease, appears after age 18 months), and adult onset (SMA type IV, Onset
is typically in the mid 30s) forms.
The genetic defects associated with SMA types I-III are localized on chromosome
5q11.
Patients with spinal muscular atrophy present with weakness and muscle wasting in
the limbs, respiratory, and bulbar or brainstem muscles. LMN signs are present i.e.
decreased tone, diminished reflexes, atrophy. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy
often have above-average intelligence quotients (IQs) and demonstrate high degrees
of intelligence.
Investigations:
1.
EMG and NCV: They are diagnostic and show anterior horn cells involvement.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
218
2
MRI brain and spine are normal.
3.
CSF study is normal.
4.
Serum CPK level may be normal or slightly elevated.
5.
Blood tests: Routine and heavy metal screening is normal.
6.
Genetic testing reveals SMN1 gene abnormality.
Management:
Supportive treatment should be aimed at improving the patients' quality of life and
minimizing disability, particularly in patients with slow progression. Refer to MND
management.
Poliomyelitis
A viral infection which, at its worst destroys the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord
and brain stem motor nuclei, causing paralysis. The disease can be mild, severely
disabling, or fatal. A feature of polio is that normal sensation accompanies the muscle
weakness. For details refer to Section A.
Guillain Barre Syndrome
Here the complaints begin with respiratory or gastric illness and progressive muscle
weakness from hours to days.It involves limbs & may be associated with
tingling,numbness in the arms.
On examination
Complaints start with progressive weakness of 2 or more limbs with neuropathy &
areflexia
Types
Ascending-Weakness starts with lower limb & then progresses upwards to the
trunk,upper limb,respiratory muscles.
Descending-Weakness will start in the cranial nerves or upper limb or bulbar muscles
& then progress downwards involving the respiratory muscles.
Investigations
1.
CSF-High protein without pleocytosis. CSF may be normal in early hours
2.
GBS antibody (GM1)
3.
Blood tests like electrolytes,LFT,CPK,ESR
4.
EMG/NCV
5.
PFT
219
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Management
If you suspect GBS immediately hospitalize the patient. ICU management will be
required in case of respiratory failure.
Immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, plasmapheresis will be needed.
Chronic care and Rehabilitation.
Myasthenia Gravis
It is a condition which is characterized by progressive weakness of
facial,bulbar,neck,and ocular muscles.This occurs due to production of antibodies to
the acetylcholine receptors on the post synaptic junction membrane, which block
conduction across the neuromuscular junction. Myasthenia symptoms can be improved
by inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase which normally removes the acetylcholine.
Here the patient may initially have ptosis, diplopia, weakness,fatigue which becomes
worse by repeated activity and which is improved by rest.Also there may be difficulty
in chewing,swallowing,breathing; combing hair, raising the arms above shoulder
level. . Limb weakness is more in proximal muscles than distal muscles. There are no
sensory nerve involvement, and the disorder is purely motor.
Bulbar muscle weakness is also common, along with weakness of head extension and
flexion. Aspiration may occur if the cough is ineffective. Patients progress from mild
to more severe disease over weeks to months. Weakness tends to spread from the
ocular to facial to bulbar muscles and then to truncal and limb muscles. Exposure to
bright sunlight, surgery, immunization, emotional stress, menstruation, and physical
factors might trigger or worsen exacerbations. The symptoms can be quickly
precipitated by various factors which is called 'myaesthenic crisis' and is a medical
emergency.
Investigations:
Laboratory testing includes Anti-AChR radioimmunoassay-85% positive in
generalized MG, 50% in ocular MG.
Anti musk antibody, anti striated muscle antibody
Single -fiber electromyography-blocking & jitter with normal fiber.
For ocular or cranial MG- exclude intracranial lesions by CT OR MRI.
Other tests for RA Factor & ANA & TSH to rule out other diseases.
D/D
Lambert syndrome (LEMS): Muscle weakness is similar to myasthenia but is associated
with tumors. It can be differentiated from myasthenia by EMG findings.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
220
Treatment
Pharmacology:
1.
Anticholinesterase inhibitors - Pyridostigmine is used for long-term maintenance.
2.
Immunosuppressants: Corticosteroids,
3.
Immunomodulators: Immunoglobulin, azathioprine, cyclosporine
4.
Plasmapheresis
Non pharmacology:
Chronic care is required for long term.
Rehabilitation is very important.
Diet advice is required if any difficulty in chewing.
Yoga helps in improving breathing capacity.

31. Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Any perinatal event (before,during,after the time of birth) could cause damage to
the brain .This could lead to mental as well as physical disabilities.These group of
disorders are known as neurodevelopmental disorders. These are sometimes noticed
immediately after birth or later in early childhood as the parents notice that the child
is not reaching the expected/appropriate milestones.
Neurodevelopmental disorders are a broad spectrum or an umbrella,which covers
multiple conditions.Broadly,they can be divided as :
A)
Cerebral palsy
B)
Mental Retardation/Intellectual disability
C)
Autism Spectrum disorders
D)
Others; would include,genetic disorders,such as Downs syndrome,learning
disability,ADHD,Slow learners
Symptoms
These disorders have a diverse clinical picture.Signs and symptoms vary depending
on the type and severity of brain damage.However, a simple guideline or yard stick
could be comparison with a normal/neurotypical child of the same age.
1.
Motor milestones such as neck holding,sitting,standing and walking, either
delayed or not achieved.child is either floppy,or very tight(spastic) or has
uncontrolled movements(dystonia/choreoathetoid movements)
2.
Speech delay :child not able to speak or can speak few words.This could also be
accompanied with swallowing,chewing difficulties(oromotor dysfunction)
3.
Not responding to being called or not tracking toys or light(hearing and vision
defect,as comorbidities)
4.
Cognitive impairment: has difficulty in understanding or learning new activities
Causes
Causes can be divided broadly into when the event has occurred:
a)
Prenatal(before birth):
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
222
Abnormal development of the brain is seen if the mother has infections (TORCH)
WHICH 
GETS 
TRANSMITTED 
INTRAUTERINE,NUTRITIONAL
DEFICIENCY IN MOTHER,CONSUMPTION OF medicines/teratogens or
hypoxia just before birth(cord around neck,meconium aspiration,prolonged
labour) or genetic mutations.
b)
Natal(at birth):
Prematurity,low birth weight,delayed cry (indicating hypoxia or lack of
oxygen),multiple births(twins,triplets,etc),septicemia in mother or placental
tissue/umbilical cord,injury at birth ( such as which may happen during forceps/
suction assisted delivery)
c)
Postnatal (after birth):
Birth asphyxia (lack of oxygen0 due to physical trauma,respiratory or cardiac
disorders, pathological jaundice,seizures/epilepsy,or morphological
abnormalities, such as hydrocephalous 9if uncorrected)
d)
Early childhood;
Trauma to the head and brain, infections such as meningitis/encephalitis,seizures/
epilepsy
e)
No obvious cause; sometimes, no cause can be identified
Neurodevelopmental disorders are a broad spectrum or an umbrella,which covers
multiple conditions.Broadly,they can be divided as :
A)
Cerebral palsy
B)
Mental Retardation/Intellectual disability
C)
Autism Spectrum disorders
D)
Others; this would include,genetic disorders,such as Downs syndrome,learning
disability,ADHD,Slow learners
Cerebral Palsy:
Cerebral palsy is a disorder causing inability to movements,incoordination,excessive
tightness, due to damage to the brain during the developmental stage(around the
time of birth and early childhood).This damage may also lead to impairments in
understanding ,cognition,learning,intellect,behavior,communication,speech,hearing
and vision.
Cerebral palsy is the leading cause of childhood disabilities in India.3 in every 100
births are diagnosed with cerebral palsy.
Types of cerebral palsy:
a)
Based on part of the body impaired/affected;
223
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Quadriplegic(all the four limbs affected)
Diplegic ( both legs affected)
Hemiplegic (an arm and leg on one side affected)
Monoplegic (only anyone limb affected)
Triplegic (both legs and one arm affected)
b)
Based on area of the brain damaged:
Spastic (increased stiffness in all muscles) - the cerebral cortex, especially, the
motor cortex is affected
Dyskinetic (abnormal movements of the body) - the basal ganglia is affected(part
of the brain controlling the voluntary movements)
Dystonic (fluctuating muscle tension) or athetoid(uncontrollable jerky
movements)
Ataxic (clumsy movements and poor balance)- cerebellar affection
Hypotonic (Floppy muscles) - this is the opposite of spastic.muscles are loose
here and may mimic muscle weakness. Injury to cerebellum may manifect as this
or hypothyroidism is also a common reason.
Here child achieves most milestones, but very late and Needs support for most
activities.
c)
Mixed:
Two or more forms may coexist.
Investigations:
1.
MRI Brain +DTI(diffusion tensor imaging) : this imaging will in most cases
clarify ,where the problem, the extent and also give an indication whether there
is a hypoxic injury.
Typically, a MRI Brain of a child with CP would show periventricular
leukomalacia (PVL),with a variation in degree and severity.
2.
EEG: In a child with co morbid seizures/fits, it is important to do an EEG.Even
otherwise, a routine EEG may give an indication of potential epileptogenic focus,
which has not manifested yet.Caution about future possibility of seizure,can be
exerted.
Treatment:
Conventional treatment consists of-
Surgical :
1)
Correction of anamolies, such as hydrocephalous using surgical means(VP shunts,
etc..)
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
224
2)
Correction of deformities (tenotomies) or use of Botox to reduce spasticity
3)
Correction of squint surgically
4)
Cochlear implants for hearing deficit(if indicated)/hearing aids
Rehabilitation: which includes physiotherapy,occupational therapy,speech
therapy,visual rehabilitation program,etc..
Medications: Medications are generally used to treat comorbid conditions, such as
seizures,dystonia,hyperactivity/aggression
Antiepileptics drugs
(AEDS generally used in children are sodium valproate (20mg/kg/day in two divided
doses),levicitram (20mg/kg/day in two divided doses).
In uncontrolled seizures, these are combined with Frisium,clobazam,etc..
Other antieplieptics, used are gardenal and tegretol (Carbemezepine)
Pacitane/Tizanidine is now used for control of dystonia/involuntary movements in
gradually increasing doses,titrated to need.
Hyperactivity :
Resperidone or triimethyl phenydilate
Advances in treatment of CP:
1.
Stem cell therapy- Over the years, various types of stem cells and cellular elements
have been used, via various routes of administration to stimulate neurogenesis
in the damaged brain, especially in children. This intervention holds more logical
attraction, since adaptive responses would be expected to be permissive in a
growing brain. Recent work in the field of stem cells is seeing an increasing
trend towards the use of either: a) Allogenic/autologous cord blood derived
cells b) Autologous bone marrow derived cells. The favoured route of
transplantation, is biased towards safety, viz. either intravenous or intrathecal
as opposed to direct stereotactic injection into the brain. (More details can be
found in the chapter of "Stem cell therapy for Neurological Disorders"..in recent
advances section)
2.
HBOT
Mental retardation
MR is a developmental disability, where intellectual functioning of an individual is
below average(as measured by standard intelligence tests).This results in significant
limitations in the persons daily living skills (adaptive functioning). Such skills
include,the ability to communicate,home living skills,self care,social skills,functional
academic skills/scholastic performance and job related skills.In intellectual disability,
the IQ(Intelligence quotient) is blow 70-75%.These children,in addition to intellectual
225
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
dysfunction,may also have comorbid seizures/convuslsions and aggressive
behaviours.
Apart from the common causes of neurodevelopmental disorders mentioned earlier,
MR/ID can also be caused by hereditary factors, such as genetic defect(Fragile X
syndrome),single gene defects like Phenylketonuria(PKU).
Diagnosis:
Psychological assessment: To properly scale the IQ is mandatory.This helps in
understanding the level of dysfunction and plan out rehabilitative measures
accordingly.
Investigations:
The investigations for MR remain broadly similar to that in Cerebral Palsy,i.e.MRI
Brain and EEG.
MRI Brain may not reveal any abnormality.Hence, PET CT Scan Brain is
recommended.(PICS),which reveals the areas of the brain which are functioning less
and thereby contributing to the intellectual disability./MR.
Genetic tests (Fragile X SYNDROME),tests for metabolic defects and inborn error of
metabolism are optional.
Treatment:
Conventional treatment:
The treatment for MR/ID ,so far, conventionally, has been only rehabilitative.These
children need to be trained in special schools, to be able to use their abilities to the
optimum,to achieve some functional independence.
Medications:
Medications are used to treat comorbid conditions, such as seizures/
epilepsy,hyperactivity and aggression .
Newer advances:
Stem cell therapy- In case of intellectual disability, any damage to the brain is a
permanent and irreversible damage as the neurons of the brain, once damaged, cannot
repair themselves on their own. The underlying neuropathology of intellectual
disability includes neuronal death along with disruption in neuronal networks, cell
migration, cell multiplication, axon growth, brain plasticity, synaptogenesis, etc. Studies
have shown that major defects are recorded in hippocampus and cerebral cortex
areas of the brain which further lead to faulty information processing and
consecutively affect the cognition and adaptive behavior. To reverse the damage
caused to the central nervous system, only a neurorestorative therapy like stem cell
therapy would be beneficial. Stem cells have a unique property of migrating towards
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
226
the damaged areas on administration. They survive, migrate, proliferate and
differentiate into the required cell types. They not only replace the dead cells but
also stimulate the endogenous cells and prevent further damage. Their paracrine
activities such as secretion of growth factors, angiogenesis, neurogenesis,
immunomodulation, decreasing inflammation, etc also help in the repair process.
This could help repair the disrupted neuronal networks in ID and hence improve the
information processing. (More details can be found in the chapter of "Stem cell therapy
for Neurological Disorders"..in recent advances section)
Autism and Autism spectrum disorders
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments or delays in
social interaction,communication and language,as well as ,, by repitive routines and
behaviours.
They are called spectrum disorders because of wide range and severity of
symptoms.The prevalence of autism has increased radically over the few
decades.Currently, the figures are 1 in 68 children in USA and 1 in 250 in India.
 This expotential rise, could partly be attributed to increasing awareness and diagnosis
of this disorder. Traditionally, till very recently, these children were misdiagnosed
as Mental retardation,which in turn lead to lack of intervention and bad
prognostication.
Like other neurodevelopmental disorders, the cause of autism is multifactorial,hence
no specific diagnostic blood investigations/biomarkers are available.
The diagnosis, is mostly clinical,based on analysis of behavioral symptoms.
Apart from the causes common to other neurodevelopmental disorders,increasing
association with some genetic causes is being seen,such as Fragile X syndrome,maternal
duplication 0f 15q1-q13,and deletions and duplications of 16p11.
Clinical symptoms:
Clinical symptoms , typically, consist of the triad of symptoms: Lack of communication,
social interaction and abstract thinking.
These lead to other secondary characteristics, like, hyperactivity, no eye contact, low
attention span, no verbalization or repetition of speech(echolalia),inability to
concentrate and learn.
Pathophysiology
Brain hypoperfusion and immune dysfunctions have been characterized as the two
main brain pathologic alterations in autism cases. Research on animal brain to study
the etiology of autism has shown that a major dysfunction of the autistic brain resides
in neural mechanisms of the structures in the medial temporal lobe, and, perhaps,
more specifically the amygdaloid complex. Distinct patterns of memory losses and
227
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
socioemotional abnormalities emerge as a result of extent of damage to the medial
temporal lobe structures.
Diagnosis and investigations
Diagnosis of autism is traditionally done by a developmental pediatrician with inputs
from psychologists.Clinical assessment scales, based on an array of questions asked
to the parents, forms the basis of diagnosis.
These scales are DSM V, CARS, ISAA.
Investigations
1.
EEG: Routinely only EEG is carried out by neurologists,to rule out potential
epiletiform activity,which is associated with a subset of autistic children.
2.
MRI Brain: grossly,MRI Brain is expected to be normal.However, it is important
to be carried out, in order to rule out correctable causes,such as brain tumor or
know the possible underlying cause, such as coexisting neurofibromatosis,corpus
callosum agenesis,hypoxia related injury,etc.
Treatment:
Conventional therapies:
Rehabilitation : Early intensive behavioral intervention -designed to facilitate
development and learning, promoting socialization, self awareness, reducing
maladaptive behaviors and educating and supporting families.
Occupational therapy,sensory integration techniques, speech therapy help in overall
development of the child
Nutritional interventions restrict allergy associated dietary components, as well as
to supplement minerals or vitamins which may be lacking. Autistic children tend to
have problems with digestion, including food sensitivity - particularly to casein and
gluten in dairy and wheat products.
Medical interventions usually treat specific activities associated with autism. Serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, and
clomipramine, are used for treatment of anxiety and depressionThey may also have
the added benefit of increasing social interaction and inhibiting repetitive behavior.
Antipsychotic drugs such as thioridazine, fluphenazine, chlorpromazine, and
haloperidol have been showed to decrease behavioral abnormalities in autism.
Atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine and ziprasidone have also
demonstrated beneficial effect at ameliorating behavioral problems.
Autism associated seizures are mainly treated by administration of anticonvulsants
such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproic acid.
Attention deficient/hyperactivity is treated by agents such as methylphenidate.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
228
Other treatments include psychiatric care, neurodevelopmental therapies, and
treatment for co-occurring medical conditions.
Recent advances;
Stem cell therapy:
The potential of stem cells for the treatment of autism is being studied extensively.
These proposals are in view of the stem cells having strong angiogenic potential
which could facilitate processes of improving perfusion by angiogenesis and balancing
inflammation by immune regulation would exhibit beneficial clinical effects in patients
with autism. Other contributing effects of the stem cells, which have been proposed
are, strong immunosuppressive activities as well as paracrine effects to stimulate
neuronal function via growth factors, such as BDNF, VEGF,NGF AND PDGF. (More
details can be found in the chapter of "Stem cell therapy for Neurological Disorders"..in
recent advances section)
Other upcoming treatments include, Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy (HBOT), Relationship
Development Intervention (RDI),Water Therapy or Aquatic Therapy, Floortime or
Developmental Individual Difference Relationship Model (DIR Model), Hippotherapy,
The Handle Method, Neurofeedback, etc.
Summary
Neurodevelopmental disorders cause delayed development of the child
in motor, sensory, speech, intellectual, and social domains. The causes
can be prenatal, perinatal or postnatal. The detection of these disorders
may be missed at birth. Therefore, family physician should carefully
examine children for developmental delay. At the earliest sign one should
refer the patient to a pediatrician. Rehabilitation at early age can accelerate
development of these children. Though there is no cure for these
conditions, the patient's family should be educated about various options
like specialized rehabilitation centres, vocational rehabilitation centres,
support groups, special schools, etc. Care of caregivers is also essential.

32. Acute Stroke
Strokes can be either ischemic or hemorrhagic. In an ischemic stroke, the blood supply
to part of the brain is cut off because a vessel is blocked due to either atherosclerosis
or a blood clot. Past medical history helps in diagnosing strokelike a history of prior
stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.
What to Examine ?
Ask for age, as it is more prevalent in over 50, history of hypertension, Diabetes,
smoking, and TIA in the last month.
Look for -
•
Loss of  sensations in an arm, leg or one side of the body
•
Weakness or paralysis
•
Partial loss of vision or hearing
•
Double vision
•
Dizziness
•
Slurred speech
•
Confused state
•
Imbalance and falling
Neurological Examination and GCS scoring should be done to establish the diagnosis.
Investigations-
•
CT brain and MRI
•
Blood glucose

33. Delirium
Delirium  is a common clinical syndrome characterized by disturbed consciousness,
confusion and decreased awareness.
Delirium may occur due to dementia, old age, fever and acute infection, particularly
in children. Poor nutrition or dehydration, severe, chronic or terminal illness, alcohol
or drug abuse or alcohol withdrawals are some of the causes for delirium.
A number of medications like analgesics or sedatives or combinations of medications
can trigger delirium. Medications for mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression
and Parkinson's disease medications can also cause delirium.
WHAT TO EXAMINE?
Physical and neurological examination
Look for
•
Dehydration
•
Infection
•
Alcohol withdrawal
A neurological exam - check vision, balance, coordination and reflexes to rule out
stroke.

37. Spine Trauma
Post traumatic spinal cord injury is often seen in road traffic accidents and construction
sites-
On receiving the patient assess for
•
Airway/Breathing: Intubation may be required but it would need sedation
(Lorazepam 1-2 mg IV) with constant monitoring
•
Circulation: Start IV access to begin IV Fluids, preferably Normal Saline
•
Immobilize the spine
What to examine?
•
Neurological assessment
•
Note the sensory level
•
Assess the motor function
•
Use the Glasgow coma score to assess the sensorium
Autonomic Control
Vital signs can be quite abnormal following spinal cord injury due to loss of autonomic
control which occurs particularly in cervical or thoracic spine injuries-
•
Note the heart rate - watch for bradycardia, the physician can use atropine
if it is not contraindicated by a head injury.
•
Note blood pressure and watch out for hypotension to rule out neurogenic
shock. Patient may need intravenous fluids to maintain BP
•
Loss of temperature control - watch for hypothermia
•
Respiratory difficulty depends on injury level and should be monitored by
asking the patient to cough and monitoring oxygen saturation
•
Watch abdomen for distension
Investigation
•
Plain X-ray of the entire cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines
•
MRI spine can be planned once the patient is stable
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians

CBC ABG Serum Electrolytes
How to manage?
First 24 hours
•
Confirm ABC
•
Immobilize the neck spine with neck collar. If a neck collar is not available
then plastic IV fluid bottles can be secured on either side of the head with
a tape, so that there is no movement of the cervical spine.
•
In case the patient needs to be resuscitated, the spinal immobilization should
be maintained. To move the patient log roll should be used
•
Take care with water temperature for washes, and use of hot or cold devices
against skin in case ofspinal cord injury patients
•
Bladder function depends on the level of spinal cord injury. It is better to
catheterize the patient to avoid neurogenic bladder where the loss of bladder
function is obvious in the initial stages
•
Refer to a neurosurgeon.
“It is important to note that injection methyl prednisolone if started within 8 hrs. of
spine cord injury has a significantly beneficial effect on the overall recovery. It is
therefore, important to shift a spine injured patient as soon as possible to a specialized
trauma hospital. if there is likely to be delay in transfer then injection methyl
prednisolone may be started as 30 mg/ kg may be given over 30 mins. and then
5.4 mg/kg per hour, continued till the patient is shifted to a specialized center.”

38. Anti Convulsants
The anticonvulsants, sometimes also called antiepileptics, belong to a diverse group
of drugs used in prevention of the occurrence of epileptic seizures. The goal of an
anticonvulsant is to suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons that start a
seizure.  A good anticonvulsant would prevent the spread of the seizure within the
brain.
Many anticonvulsants block sodium (Na+) channels, calcium (Ca2+) channels, ampa
receptors or nmda receptors. Some anticonvulsants inhibit the metabolism of gaba or
increase its release.

Benzodiazepines
The benzodiazepines are a class of drugs with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, anxiolytic,
amnestic and muscle relaxant properties. Long-term use can be problematic due to
the development of tolerance and dependency
Mechanism of action
Benzodiazepines act by increasing neuronal membrane permeability to Cl ions by
binding to stereospecific benzodiazepine receptors on the postsynaptic GABA neuron
within the CNS and enhancing the GABA inhibitory effects, which in turn result in
hyperpolarisation and stabilisation.
Contraindications: Severe hepatic impairment; respiratory depression; acute narrow-
angle glaucoma; pregnancy and lactation.
Special Precautions need to be taken in cases of hepatic and renal dysfunction;
pulmonary insufficiency; and myasthenia gravis. These drugs may impair the ability
to drive or operate machinery.
Adverse Drug Reactions: Drowsiness, headache, dizziness, confusion; blurred vision;
weakness; unsteadiness. Respiratory depression is a serious complication.
Drug Interactions: Potentiation of CNS depression produced by alcohol; general
anaesthetics; narcotic analgesics; TCAs; MAOIs; phenothiazines; antipsychotics;
barbiturates; scopolamine
The following benzodiazepines are used to treat status epilepticus:
Diazepam
It is preffered in acute panic states & anxiety associated with organic disease
Onset of action: Almost immediate (IV); rapid (oral).
Duration: IV: 20-30 min.
Absorption: Time to peak plasma concentration: Approx 30-90 min (oral); approx 10-
30 min (rectal).
Distribution: Plasma protein binding: 98-99%.
Metabolism: Extensively hepatic via CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 isoenzymes to
desmethyldiazepam (active metabolite).
Excretion: Via urine (as free or conjugated metabolites). Biphasic half-life: Rapid
(initial), 1 or 2 days (terminal), 2-5 days (desmethyldiazepam).
Indications : anxiety, tension, muscle spasm, psychosomatic & behaviour disorders
Contraindications : acute  narrow  angle glaucoma, hypersentivity to benzodiazepines.
myasthenia gravis.
Special precautions to be taken in hepatic & renal impairment patients
253
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Side effects : drowsiness,altered activeness,vertigo,increased appetite & weight gain
Dosage
Parenteral
Seizures
Adult: Initially, 5-10 mg IV repeated at 10- to 15-min intervals up to max 30 mg. On
stoppage of seizures, appropriate maintenance therapy to be started. Initial dose at
2-4 hr interval may be started. IM administration could be done if IV is not possible.
Child: 30 days to 5 yr: Initially, 0.1-0.5 mg IV, may be repeated every 2-5 min up to
max 5-10 mg;
>5 yr Initially, 1 mg, may be repeated every 2-5 min up to max 10 mg. Followed by
maintenance treatment.
Elderly: dosage should not exceed half the adult dose.
Dose reduction may be required in hepatic impairment.
Lorazepam
Adult: 4 mg injected slowly, may be repeated once after 10 minutes if seizures recur.
Dose should be given at a rate not >2 mg/minute into a large vein.
Child: Neonates and children up to 12 yr: 0.1 mg/kg (max: 4 mg) as a single dose,
may be repeated once after 10 minutes if needed
Lorazepam is a short acting benzodiazepine. Lorazepam enhances the inhibitory effect
of GABA on neuronal excitability by modulating GABA receptors.
Onset of action: Hypnosis: anticonvulsant: 5 min (IV), 30-60 min (oral).
Duration: 6-8 hr.
Absorption: peak plasma concentrations after 2 hr.
Distribution: Crosses the placenta and blood-brain barrier; enters breast milk. Protein-
binding: 85%.
Metabolism: Hepatic; converted to inactive metabolites.
Excretion: Urine and faeces; 10-20 hr (elimination half-life).
Indications: anxiety, status epilepticus, sedation
Containdications: Severe hepatic impairment; respiratory depression; acute narrow-
angle glaucoma; pregnancy and lactation.
Midazolam
Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine.
Absorption: Rapidly absorbed (any route); peak plasma concentrations after 20-60
min (depending on route).
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
254
Distribution:  Protein-binding: 96%
Metabolism: Extensively hepatic via CYP3A4 isoenzyme; converted to
hydroxymethylmidazolam.
Excretion: Urine (as glucuronide conjugates); 2 hr (elimination half-life), prolonged
in neonates, elderly and hepatic impairment
Indications: The midazolam nasal spray is only used when an epileptic seizure lasts
more than ten minutes. Seizures that last this long can cause status epilepticus.
Midazolam nasal sprays are also used to stop the seizures as soon as possible.
Dosage
The midazolam nasal spray is very easy to use, even for someone that has never used
it before. For new sprays a few pumps are required to clear the spray of air. During
epileptic seizures, generally one spray per nostril is sufficient for the patient to recover
from it. As each spray contains 2,5 mg midazolam, this sums up to a total dosage of
5 mg. For some patients 10 mg of midazolam is used.
Alprazolam
It is a triazolo analogue  of benzodiazepine,which is indicated in antianxiety
Mechanism of action:
Alprazolam has anxiolytic, muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant, antidepressant and sleep-
modifying effects. It binds to the ? aminobutyric acid (GABA)-specific sites throughout
the CNS, leading to an increase in the inhibitory effect of GABA on neuronal
excitability.
Absorption:  peak plasma concentrations after 1-2 hrs.
Distribution: Protein-binding: 70-80%
Metabolism: Hepatic; converted to ?-hydroxyalprazolam and benzophenone.
Excretion: Urine (as unchanged drug and metabolites); 11-15 hrs (elimination half-
life).
Indications-anxiety disorders,anxiety associated depression, sedation (mild)
Dosage
Oral
Short-term management of anxiety
Adult: 0.25-0.5 mg tid, increased to 3-4 mg daily if necessary.
Elderly: Initially, 0.25 mg bid/tid.

Hydantoins
Phenytoin
Phenytoin is available at a relatively low cost, making it one of the most affordable
seizure control medications. It is available in extended release capsules and injectable
forms.
Mechanism of action
Phenytoin acts as an anticonvulsant by increasing efflux or decreasing influx of sodium
ions across cell membranes in the motor cortex, thus stabilising neuronal membranes
and decreasing seizure activity.
Distribution: Widely distributed. Protein-binding: 90%.
Metabolism: Extensively hepatic; converted to inactive metabolites.
Excretion: Via urine as hydroxylated metabolite; elimination half life at steady state:
22 hr.
Dosage
Oral
Epilepsy
Adult: Initially, 3-4 mg/kg daily as single dose or in divided doses. Alternatively,
150-300 mg daily increased gradually to 600 mg daily if necessary. Maintenance: 200-
500 mg daily.
Child: Initially, 5 mg/kg daily in 2-3 divided doses. Maintenance: 4-8 mg/kg daily in
divided doses. Max dose: 300 mg daily.
Intravenous
Tonic-clonic status epilepticus
Adult: Adjunctive therapy with a benzodiazepine (e.g. diazepam): 10-15 mg/kg by
slow inj or intermittent infusion at a max rate of 50 mg/min. Maintenance: 100 mg IV
(or orally) given every 6-8 hr.
Child: Neonates: 20 mg/kg as a loading dose, then 2.5-5 mg/kg bid; 1 mth-12 yr: 18
mg/kg as a loading dose, then 2.5-5 mg/kg bid; >12 yr: 18 mg/kg as a loading dose,
then up to 100 mg 3-4 times daily.
Phenytoin has a narrow therapeutic window. Hence, a fine balance must be maintained
between its efficacy and dose-related side effects. Phenytoin demonstrates non-linear
pharmacokinetics, which causes the enzyme system involved to become saturated
with phenytoin, even with a small change in dose and can lead to a large change in
phenytoin levels.Thus, monitoring phenytoin plasma levels regularly is necessary to
decide the next appropriate dosage. Target plasma rangeof  phenytoin: 10-20 mg/L
257
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Indications: epilepsy, status epilepticus, migraine,trigeminal neuralgia
Contraindications : Pregnancy, IV administration in sinus bradycardia, heart block,
or Stokes-Adams syndrome.
Special precautions - Precautions should be taken while administering intravenously
in patients with hypotension, heart failure, Patient's BP and ECG should be monitored
during therapy. IV must be given slowly (too rapid admin may cause hypotension,
CNS depression, cardiac arrhythmias and impaired heart conduction). Therapy should
not be discontinued abruptly as it may increase seizure frequency.
Side effects- headache, dizziness, tremor, insomnia, tenderness and hyperplasia of
the gums, acne, hirsutism, osteomalacia. Phenytoin toxicity is manifested as a syndrome
of cerebellar, vestibular, ocular effects, notably nystagmus, diplopia, slurred speech,
and ataxia; also with mental confusion, dyskinesias, exacerbations of seizure frequency,
hyperglycaemia. Prolonged use may affect mental function and cognition in children.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome could occur in serious adverse
events.
Fosphenytoin
Mechanism of action
Fosphenytoin is converted to phenytoin in the body. It modulates voltage-dependent
Na channels of neurons.
Absorption: Plasma concentrations peak after 30 minutes (IM).
Distribution: Displaces phenytoin from binding sites. Protein-binding: 95-99%.
Metabolism: Complete; hydrolysed to phenytoin, phosphate and formaldehyde.
Excretion: Urine (as inactive metabolites).
Dosage:
Parenteral
Tonic-clonic status epilepticus
Adult: As Phenytoin sodium equivalents (PSE): Loading dose: 15 mg/kg, given via
IV infusion at a rate of 100-150 mg/minute. Maintenance: Initially, 4-5 mg PSE/kg/
day by IM inj or IV infusion at a rate of 50-100 mg PSE/minute; subsequent doses
depend on patient's response and trough-plasma phenytoin levels.
Child: As Phenytoin sodium equivalents (PSE): Loading dose: 15 mg/kg, given via
IV infusion at a rate of 2-3 mg/kg/minute. Maintenance: Initially, 4-5 mg/kg/day by

given via IM inj or IV infusion at a rate of 1-2 mg/kg/minute. Maintenance: Initially,
4-5 mg/kg/day by IM inj or IV infusion at a rate of 1-2 mg/kg/minute; subsequent
doses depend on patient's response and trough-plasma phenytoin levels.
Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction or slower infusion may be needed.
Indications: status epilepticus, as a substitute for phenytoin
Contraindications: Porphyria; sinus bradycardia; SA block; 2nd- and 3rd-degree
heart block; Stokes-Adams syndrome; pregnancy, lactation.
Special Precautions: Hepatic or renal impairment; elderly; patients requiring
phosphate restriction. Monitor ECG, BP and respiratory function during infusion;
observe patient for at least 30 minutes after infusion. IV infusion rate should not
exceed 150 mg PSE/minute in adults or 3 mg PSE/kg/minute in children ?5 yr.

which could be fatal.
Fatty acids
The valproates - valproic acid, sodium valproate, and divalproex sodium are
anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drugs
Mechanism of Action:
Valproate is a carboxylic acid anticonvulsant which increases levels of ?-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) in the brain.
Absorption:  Time to peak plasma concentration: Oral: Approx 4 hr; extended release:
4-17 hr.
Distribution: Plasma protein binding (concentration dependent): 80-90%; free
fraction: Increases from approx 10% at 40 mcg/mL to approx 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL;
decreases in the elderly and patients w/ hepatic or renal impairment. Crosses the
placenta; enters breast milk.
Metabolism: Valpromide is almost completely and rapidly metabolised in the liver
to valproic acid. Valproic acid is extensively metabolised by liver, via glucuronidation
and mitochondrial ?-oxidation.
Excretion: Excreted in urine (30-50% as glucuronide conjugate; <3% as unchanged
drug), small amounts in faeces and expired air. Elimination half-life: Adult: 5-20 hr;

Barbiturates
Barbiturates are drugs that act as central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and
bring about mild sedation to anesthesia. The following are classified as anticonvulsants:
Phenobarbital - it is the most widely used anticonvulsant. It also has sedative and
hypnotic properties.
Mechanism of action:
Phenobarbitone is a short-acting barbiturate. It depresses the sensory cortex, reduces
motor activity, changes cerebellar function, and produces drowsiness, sedation and
hypnosis. Its anticonvulsant property is exhibited at high doses.

GABA analogs
Gabapentin- used as an adjunctive medication to control partial seizures (effective
when added to other antiseizure drugs). Gabapentin is well tolerated in most patients,
has a relatively mild side-effect profile, and passes through the body unmetabolized.
Mechanism of Action
Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA but is neither a
GABA agonist nor antagonist. High affinity gabapentin binding sites are located
throughout the brain. These sites correspond to the presence of voltage-gated Ca
channels particularly controlling the ?-2/?-1 subunit. This channel appears to be located
presynaptically and may modulate the release of excitatory neurotransmitters which
participate in epileptogenesis and nociception.
Absorption: Absorbed from the GI tract. Bioavailability may be increased w/ food
esp high-fat meals. Time to peak plasma concentration: W/in 2-3 hr; 5 hr in fasting
state and 7.3 hr (as enacarbil).
Distribution: Enters breast milk. Volume of distribution: 58 ± 6 L. Plasma protein
binding: <3%.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
268
Metabolism: As enacarbil: Undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism mainly in
enterocytes and liver (to a lesser extent) to form gabapentin, CO2, acetaldehyde and
isobutyric acid.
Excretion: Via urine (as unchanged drug) and the remainder in the faeces. Elimination
half-life: Approx 5-7 hr.
Dosage
Oral

Distribution : Widely distributed throughout the body, but not significantly bound
to plasma proteins.
Metabolism : Extensively hydroxylated in the liver to its principal metabolite which
is inactive.
Excretion : Excreted in the urine mainly as metabolite, either free or conjugated.
Dosage
Oral

count, liver function tests, and urinalysis should be performed periodically. Drug
increase the risk of grand mal seizures when used alone in mixed types of epilepsy.
Avoid sudden withdrawal. May impair ability to drive or operate machinery.
Clobazam
Mechanism of action
Clobazam binds to one or more specific GABA receptors at several sites within the
CNS. Increased permeability of neuronal membrane to chloride ions results in GABA's
inhibitory effect leading to hyperpolarisation and stabilisation.

39. Analgesics
An analgesic (commonly known as a painkiller) is any member of the diverse group
of drugs used to relieve pain.  Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the peripheral
and central nervous system; they include paracetamol (acetaminophen), the
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as the salicylates, narcotic drugs
such as morphine, synthetic drugs with narcotic properties such as tramadol, and
various others. Some other classes of drugs not normally considered analgesics are
used to treat neuropathic pain syndromes; these include tricyclic antidepressants
and anticonvulsants.
Paracetamol
Mechanism of action
Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse
generation. IIts weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Onset: Oral: <1 hr. IV: 5-10 min (analgesia); w/in 30 min (antipyretic).
Duration: 4-6 hr (analgesia). IV: 6 hr (antipyretic).
Absorption:  Time to peak plasma concentration: Approx 10-60 min (oral).
Distribution: Distributed into most body tissues; crosses the placenta and enters
breast milk. Plasma protein binding: Approx 25%.
Metabolism: Hepatic via glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugation. N-acetyl-p-
benzoquinoneimine (minor hydroxylated metabolite), is usually produced in very
small amounts by CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes in the liver and kidneys.
Excretion: Mainly via urine (as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, <5% as unchanged
drug). Elimination half-life: Approx 1-3 hr.
Dosage

273
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Side effects : epigastric pain
Aceclofenac
Dosage : 100mg orally bd,dosages reduction to be considered in hepatic impairment
Indications : for pain relief and inflammation

bronchial asthma; history of heart failure or hypertension; mild renal, hepatic or
cardiac impairment. May impair ability to drive or operate machinery.
Side effects : dizziness, nephrotoxicity; blood dyscrasias could be fatal.
Opiates and Morphinomimetics
Morphine, the archetypal opioid, and various other substances (e.g. Codeine,
oxycodone, hydrocodone, diamorphine, pethidine) all exert a similar influence on
the cerebral opioid receptor system. Tramadol and buprenorphine are thought to be
partial agonists of the opioid receptors. Dosing of all opioids may be limited by
opioid toxicity (confusion, myoclonic jerks and pinpoint pupils), but there is no dose
ceiling in patients who tolerate this.
Mechanism of action
Morphine is a phenanthrene derivative which acts mainly on the CNS and smooth
muscles. It binds to opiate receptors in the CNS altering pain perception and response.
Analgesia isthought to be due to its action at the mu-1 receptors
Onset: Approx 30 min (conventional tab); 5-10 min (IV).
Duration: 4 hr (conventional tab); 8-24 hr (extended-release tab/cap).
Distribution: Distributed throughout the body mainly in the kidneys, liver, lungs
and spleen, w/ lower concentrations in the brain and muscles. Crosses the blood-
brain barrier and placenta; enters breast milk. Volume of distribution: 1-6 L/kg.
Plasma protein binding: Approx 35%.
Metabolism: Metabolised in the liver and gut via glucuronidation to produce
morphine-3-glucoronide and morphine-6-glucoronide; undergoes extensive first-pass
metabolism.
Excretion: Via urine (approx 90%) and through the bile into the faeces (10%) mainly
as conjugates. Mean plasma elimination half-life: Approx 2 hr (morphine); 2.4-6.7 hr

Specific agents
In patients with chronic or neuropathic pain, various other substances may have
analgesic properties. Tricyclic antidepressants, especially amitriptyline, have been
shown to improve pain in what appears to be a central manner. The exact mechanism
of carbamazepine, gabapentin and pregabalin is similarly unclear, but these
anticonvulsants are used to treat neuropathic pain.
Amitriptyline
Mechanism of action
Amitriptyline is a dibenzocycloheptadiene tricyclic antidepressant. It increases synaptic

Combinations
Analgesics are frequently used in combination, such as the paracetamol and codeine
preparations found in many non-prescription pain relievers. They can also be found
in combination with vasoconstrictor drugs such as pseudoephedrine for sinus-related
patients.the use of paracetamol, as well as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and other
nsaids concurrently with weak to mid-range opiates has been shown to have beneficial
effects.

42. Muscle Relaxants and
Antispastic Drugs
Muscle Relaxants
Muscle relaxants are drugs which affect skeletal muscle function and decrease the
muscle tone. They are used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, and
hyperreflexia.
Some commonly used muscle relaxants are:

Botox
Botulinum toxin is a protein and neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium
botulinum.
Botulinum toxin Type A (BTX-A) is a common treatment for muscles affected by the
upper motor neuron syndrome which causes spasticity in a group of muscles. Botox
injections inhibit muscle spasticity by weakening or paralyzing certain muscles or by
blocking the nerves involved in hypertonicity.
291
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Mechanism of action
BTX-A inhibits the release of acetylcholine (the neurotransmitter that activates muscles).
Botox paralyzes muscle by stopping acetylcholine release. BTX-A reduces both
voluntary and involuntary motor activity of the muscles.
Indications:
•
Severe spascticity in a muscle or muscle groups due to UMN lesions.
•
Spasticity not improved by antispastic drugs and other measures.
•
Cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis)
•
Local intradermal injection of BTX-A in chronic focal neuropathies.
•
Idiopathic and neurogenic detrusor overactivity
•
Pediatric incontinence, incontinence due to overactive bladder, and
incontinence due to neurogenic bladder
•
Movement disorders associated with stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
disease, or cerebral palsy
•
Focal dystonias affecting the limbs, face, jaw, or vocal cords
Contraindications: pregnancy, lactation
Side effects : paralysis of the wrong muscle group and allergic reaction, pain, swelling,
or bruising at the injection site, flu-like symptoms, headache.
Advantages : The advantage of Botox is its ease of administration. The effects of
Botox last for about three to twelve months. Botox injection can be given to a single
muscle or muscle group; where focal a action is required. Local injections act locally,
and thus, a widespread action is prevented.
Disadvantages : Injections have to be repeated every six months. Botox paralyzes
both voluntary and involuntary muscle activity. The weakness due to botox may
contribute to further dysfunction in patients who anticipate to use the muscles. The
side-effects and the development of immune responses to the toxin are significant
drawbacks of repeated injections. It is not suitable for treatment of widespread
spasticity, spasms, and other abnormal activity affecting many muscle groups.
Alternatives to Botox injections are available and used when injections of Botox are
contraindicated or may cause serious adverse effects. These are surgical methods,
such as lengthening of tendons of spastic and shortened muscles, denervation of the
spastic muscles, etc.

Drugs controlling tremors
Levodopa
Levodopa is a dopaminergic agent which is used in the treatment of parkinson's
disease.
Mechanism of action
Levodopa increases dopamine levels in the brain leading to the stimulation of
dopamine receptors.
Absorption: Peak plasma concentrations within 2 hr.
Distribution: Protein-binding: 10-30%. Penetrates the blood-brain barrier; crosses
the placenta; distributed into breast milk.
Metabolism: Metabolised in the gut, liver and kidney; decarboxylated by L-
aminodecarboxylase to dihydrophenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid
(HVA). Other routes: O-methylation, transamination, oxidation.
Excretion: Via urine within 24 hr (80% as metabolites); via faeces (minimal amounts).
30-60 min (elimination half-life).
Dosage

293
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Levodopa and Carbidopa
Levodopa, a precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and gets
converted to dopamine in the basal ganglia while carbidopa is a dopa-decarboxylase
inhibitor. The latter prevents conversion of L-dopa to dopamine outside the brain
and minimises side effects.
Dosage
Oral
As monotherapy in Parkinson's disease
Adult: Per tablet contains L-dopa 100 mg and carbidopa 25 mg. Initially, 1 tab tid.
Increase by 1 tab/day every 1-2 days up to a max. of 8 tabs of any strength/day. If
the patient has been taking L-dopa alone, the combination should be started after a
gap of at least 8 hr after stopping L-dopa.
Levodopa and Benserazide
Levodopa is the metabolic precursor of dopamine. Only a small amount of administered
Levodopa enters blood-brain barrier unaltered and the remainder is converted
peripherally to dopamine by dopa-decarboxylase. Benserazide is a peripheral
decarboxylase inhibitor that reduces the peripheral conversion of Levodopa;
concurrent admin enables dosage of Levodopa to be reduced and may diminish
peripheral side effects such as nausea and vomiting.
Dosage
Oral
Parkinson's disease
Adult: Standard forms or Dispersible form Available in Levodopa (mg)/Benserazide
(mg) formulations 50/12.5, 100/25, 200/50. Doses expressed as Levodopa: Initially
50 mg 3 or 4 times daily (100 mg tid in advance stage disease); gradually increase by
100 mg daily once or twice wkly. Effective dose range: 400-800 mg daily in divided
doses; most require < 600 mg daily. Patients previously on levodopa monotherapy:
Initiate with 10-15% of the usual dose previously taken. Patient previously on other
levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase combination therapy: Withdraw previous therapy for
12 hr before initiating therapy at 50 mg 3 or 4 times daily.

44. Neuroprotective Agents
Neuroprotective Drugs
Neuroprotective agents are used in an attempt to save ischemic neurons in the brain
from irreversible injury. Studies in animals indicate a period of at least 4 hours after
onset of complete ischemia in which many potentially viable neurons exist in the
ischemic penumbra (ie, the rim of the infarct). In humans, the ischemia may be less
complete, and the time window may be longer, but human patients also tend to be
older, with comorbidities that may limit benefit.
2 types of neuroprotective agents, one that prevents early ischemic injury and another
that prevents reperfusion injury.
I. Prevention of early ishemic injury
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists
By preventing excitatory neurotransmitter release, neuroprotective agents may reduce
deleterious effects of ischemia on cells.
A. Memantine
Memantine, a derivative of amantadine, is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA)-receptor antagonist. It affects transmission of glutamate, the primary
excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. Glutamate may contribute to the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer's disease by overstimulating various glutamate receptors resulting in
excitotoxicity and neuronal cell death.
Dosage
Oral
Moderate to severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease
Adult: As hydrochloride: Initially, 5 mg daily in the morning for the 1st wk; increase
dose wkly in steps of 5 mg. Max: 20 mg daily. Wait for at least 1 wk between dose
changes. Doses ?10 mg/day should be given in 2 divided doses. Suggested titration:
5 mg daily for ?1 wk; 5 mg bid for ?1 wk; 15 mg daily given in 5- and 10-mg separated
doses for ?1 wk; then 10 mg bid.
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
296
Renal impairment : Depending on creatine clearance; 40-60 ml/min: Max dose: 10
mg/day
Side effects : Dizziness, confusion, headache, somnolence, hallucinations, tiredness,
anxiety, abnormal gait, hypertonia, cystitis and increased libido.
B. Magnesium
Magnesium is another agent with actions on the NMDA receptor and a low incidence
of adverse effects. It may reduce ischemic injury by increasing regional blood flow,
antagonizing voltage-sensitive calcium channels, and blocking the NMDA receptor.
In myocardial infarction and small stroke studies, patients tolerated the drug.
Dosage : 400 to 800 mg orally once a day.
II. Prevention of reperfusion injury
Citicoline
Citicoline is an exogenous form of cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) used
in membrane biosynthesis. Citicoline may reduce ischemic injury by stabilizing
membranes and decreasing free radical formation. Citicoline increases blood flow
and O2 consumption in the brain. It is also involved in the biosynthesis of lecithin.
Dosage
Oral
Adult: 200-600 mg daily in divided doses.
Piracetam
It is a nootrophic agent and used as a cognitive enhancer.
Indication - cerebral vascular accidents and cerebral insufficiency,ischemic or even
haemorrhagic acute accidents,mental retardation in children,behaviour & psychotic
problems
Dosage - adult-800 mg 3 times a day.
Children - 50mg/kg body weight
Contraindication - severe renal impairment or hepatic functions and Cerebral
haemorrhage.
Special precaution - impaired renal or hepatic functions,cardiac disorders.
Side effects: Hyperkinesia, nervousness, depression, CNS stimulation, sleep
disturbances, dizziness, excitement, wt gain.
Ginkgo biloba
Indication - cerebral impairment due to organic degeneration of cortex,multiple
vascular infarcts, headache, sleep disturbances, dizziness, tinnitus
297
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Dosages - 40 mg 3 times a day.
Contraindication - acute phase of cerebrovascular accidents, acute myocardial
infarction, hypotension, pregnancy & hypersensitivity to ingrediants.
Special precautions - nausea, gi, upsets, heart, palpitation
Vitamins
Vitamins like vitamin B1, B6, B12 and folate are also used for neuroprotection.
Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)
It is a water soluble vitamin, important for metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins
and fats. It helps in GABA synthesis in the CNS and release of glycogen stored in
muscles.
Dosage : 150 mg daily
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 plays a significant role in the synthesis and maintenance of myelin. The
neurological problems caused by vitamin B12 deficiency are due to the damage caused
to the myelin sheath.
Thus, Vit B12 medications and supplements are given in the treatment of peripheral
neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy and to prevent neurological disturbances.
Methylcobalamin is known to help repair the damage caused by diabetic neuropathy
by modulating the protein kinase C signaling pathway or activating chemical signals.
Vitamin B12 also helps protect against brain atrophy or shrinkage associated with
Alzheimer's disease and impaired cognitive function.
Dosage : 1500 mcg/day
Vitamin C
Vitamin C is one of many antioxidants. Antioxidants are nutrients that Prevent damage
caused from free radicals. Intracellular ascorbate in the CNS provides antioxidant
protection, peptide amidation, myelin formation, synaptic potentiation, and protection
against glutamate toxicity. Thus, it protects neurons from the oxidant damage
associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and
Huntington's disease.
Dosage : 500mg/day
Vitamin E
Vit E is important for the maintenance of the integrity and stability of biological
membranes, and for the protection of  the phospholipids of biological membranes
from peroxidation. Vit E deficiency has been known to cause degeneration and loss
of sensory axons in the posterior columns, sensory roots, and peripheral nerves. This
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
298
degeneration results from axonal membrane injury and then develops as an
axonopathy.
Dosage : 400 mg/day
Folate
Folic acid is known to have some roles in the production of neurotransmitters
necessary for nerve conduction. Folate deficiency may lead to cognitive impairment,
dementia, depression, peripheral neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration
of the spinal cord.
Dosage : 1.5 mg/day
Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)
Thiamine is a water soluble vitamin. It is an essential coenzyme in carbohydrate
metabolism.
Dosage : As a prophylaxis: 10-25 mg daily
In Thiamine deficiency: 300 mg daily
Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome: 100 mg by slow IV over 10 minutes; then 50-100
mg/day IM or IV until he can take oral
CoQ10 or Ubiquinone
CoQ10 acts as an antioxidant and membrane stabilizer. It is also involved in the
electron transport chain, and is an important component for production of ATPs
(energy) for cell functions. It is used in the treatment of mitochondrial cytopathies,
Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, muscular dystrophies, migraine headaches
and myopathies.
CoQ10 is used as a cardioprotective agent in cases of muscular dystrophy. In multiple
studies, CoQ10 was found to be safe and well tolerated up to 1200 mg/day.
Dosage :
Adult: 300 mg bid, maximum 1200 mg/day
Children : 300 mg once a day
Ubiquinol
Ubiquinol is an oxidized form of CoQ10 and acts as an antioxidant.It is the most
common form of CoQ10 and accounts for more than 80% of the total ubiquinol and
ubiquinone pool in human plasma. It is used in neurodegenerative disorders, for e.g.
Parkinson's disease, dementia, etc. Indications of ubiquinol use are same as of CoQ10.
The bioavailability of ubiquinol is higher than CoQ10.
Dosage : Adults: 100 mg bid
Children: 50 mg bid or 100 mg od

45. Use of tPA in
Acute Ischemic Stroke
Stroke most often occurs as a result of acute vascular occlusion, and therefore acute
revascularization is crucial. Prompt revascularization to restore perfusion minimizes
the extent of infarction and improves neurologic outcome.
Importance of tPA

Recommendations
1.
Intravenous rtPA (0.9 mg/kg, maximum dose 90 mg) is recommended for selected
patients who may be treated within 3 hours of onset of ischemic stroke.
2.
In patients eligible for intravenous rtPA, benefit of therapy is time dependent,
and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible. The door-to-needle
time (time of bolus administration) should be within 60 minutes from hospital
arrival
3.
Intravenous rtPA is reasonable in patients whose blood pressure can be lowered
safely (to below 185/110 mmHg) with antihypertensive agents, with the physician
assessing the stability of the blood pressure before starting intravenous rtPA.
4.
In patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy, physicians should be aware of and
prepared to emergently treat potential side effects, including bleeding
complications and angioedema that may cause partial airway obstruction
5.
Use of intravenous fibrinolysis in patients with conditions of mild stroke deficits,
rapidly improving stroke symptoms, major surgery in the preceding 3 months,
and recent myocardial infarction may be considered, and potential increased
risk should be weighed against the anticipated benefits
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians

6.
The intravenous administration of streptokinase for treatment of stroke is not
recommended
Monitoring of the patient
Admit the patient to an intensive care or stroke unit for monitoring.
If the patient develops severe headache, acute hypertension, nausea, or vomiting or
has a worsening neurological examination, discontinue the infusion (if IV rtPA is
being administered) and obtain emergent CT scan.
Measure blood pressure and perform neurological assessments every 15 minutes
during and after IV rtPA infusion for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then
hourly until 24 hours after IV rtPA treatment.
Increase the frequency of blood pressure measurements if systolic blood pressure is
>180 mmHg or if diastolic blood pressure is >105 mmHg; administer antihypertensive
medications to maintain blood pressure at or below these levels
Delay placement of nasogastric tubes, indwelling bladder catheters, or intraarterial
pressure catheters if the patient can be safely managed without them.
Obtain a follow-up CT or MRI scan at 24 hours after IV rtPA before starting
anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.

46. Role of Hyperbaric Oxygen
Therapy in Neurological Disorders
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment which enhances the body's
natural healing process by inhalation of 100% oxygen in a total body chamber, where
atmospheric pressure is increased and controlled. It is used for a wide variety of
treatments usually as a part of an overall medical care plan.
Under normal circumstances, oxygen is transported throughout the body only by
red blood cells. With HBOT, oxygen is dissolved into all of the body's fluids, the
plasma, the central nervous system fluids, the lymph, and the bone and can be carried
to areas where circulation is diminished or blocked. In this way, extra oxygen can
reach all of the damaged tissues and the body can support its own healing process.
The increased oxygen greatly enhances the ability of white blood cells to kill bacteria,
reduces swelling and allows new blood vessels to grow more rapidly into the affected
areas. It is a simple, non-invasive and painless treatment.
Indications:
FDA has approved HBOT for treatment of brain abscess and acute traumatic ischemia.
Off label indications for neurological disorders are:
Brain injury
Autism
Cerebral palsy
Migraine
Alzheimer's disease
Attention deficit hyperactive disorder
Multiple sclerosis
Motor neuron disease
Neuropathies
Dementia
Depression
Coma
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
308
Parkinson's disease
Epilepsy/Seizure disorders
Encephalomyelitis
Spinal cord injury
Stroke
Process or Procedure:
The patient is on a table that slides into the
transparent chamber which is about 7 feet long.
The pressure inside the chamber is increased slowly.  Children can be accompanied
with a parent and can play or drink inside the chamber. One can see and talk to the
technician at all times. The chamber is sealed and filled with 100% oxygen and pressure
is increased to 1.5 to  2.5 times the normal air pressure which may cause some ear
popping or mild discomfort. Pure, 100 percent oxygen is continuously maintained
and circulated throughout the chamber during the treatment .The session will last
anywhere from 45 minutes to one hour. At the end slow decompression of the chamber
is carried out to avoid decompression sickness. Usually, 40 hourly sessions are
conducted.
Benefits :
Healing  in most areas of the body requires appropriate oxygen levels in the tissue.
Most illnesses and injuries occur, and often linger, at the cellular or tissue level. In
many cases, such as: circulatory problems; non-healing wounds; and strokes, adequate
oxygen cannot reach the damaged area and the body's natural healing ability is unable
to function properly. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy provides this extra oxygen naturally
and with minimal side effects.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the quality of life of the patient in many areas
when standard medicine is not working. Many conditions such as stroke, cerebral
palsy, head injuries, and chronic fatigue have been reported to respond favorably to
HBOT.
Hyperbaric oxygen is used to treat all conditions which benefit from increased tissue
oxygen availability either as the primary therapy, or in conjunction with other drugs.
HBOT in brain injury or stroke:
Following an injury to the brain, either from trauma or lack of oxygen, cellular plasma
leaks out into surrounding brain tissue causing swelling and reducing blood flow.
The pressure on these cells,hampers their normal function,due to inadequate
oxygenation.HBOT facilitates  increase in  the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood
/ plasma, making oxygen available to heal damaged capillary walls, preventing plasma
leakage and reducing swelling. As the swelling decreases, blood flow can be restored
to the dormant tissue (neovascularization) and these cells then have the potential to
function again.
309
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
A clinical trial, aimed to evaluate whether increasing the level of dissolved oxygen
by Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) could activate neuroplasticity in patients
with chronic neurologic deficiencies due to stroke was carried out and published in
2013 by Shai Efrati,,et al.,from Israel.The results indicate that HBOT can lead to
significant neurological improvements in post stroke patients even at chronic late
stages. The observed clinical improvements implied that neuroplasticity can still be
activated long after damage onset in regions where there is a brain SPECT/CT
(anatomy/physiology) mismatch.
HBOT in a child with cerebral palsy (CP)
In CP patients, some of the injured brain tissues may be "dormant" and non-functioning.
HBOT can stimulate these "dormant" tissues and return them to more normal function.
In young children, cognitive function and spasticity can be improved.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, used in conjunction with other therapies, ensures the
best recovery possible for children with cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury.
HBOT  In autism:
the pathogenetic mechanisms postulated are cerebral hypoperfusion, inflammation,
oxidative stress, and immune dysregulation.  Studies have shown that children with
autism may have decreased blood flow through the social brain (mesial temporal,
amygdala, etc). Less blood flow results in decreased oxygen supply to these areas.
The chances of the hypoxic tissue to receive more oxygen increases by enhanced
supply. HBOT not only increases the oxygen in the blood but also allows the oxygen
to effortlessly cross cell membranes and enter all of the other body's fluid systems.
This cumulatively improves the transport of oxygen in the body. It stimulates
angiogenesis, reduces oxidative stress by stimulating superoxide dismutase, reduces
inflammation and stimulates local stem cells. This improves the neuronal functions.
HBOT thus reverses the neurological abnormalities. Clinically, this leads to
improvement in cognition, socialization, language, behavior, eye contact, etc in children
with autism.
Contraindications: (for children and their parents): Absolute: pneumothorax and
severe congestive heart failure. Relative: History of seizures, febrile illness (lower
threshold for seizures and prolonged removal time due to slow decompression incase
of an event), recent ear surgery, chronic sinusitis, active upper respiratory infection,
(due to inability to equalize the ear pressure). Asthma, emphysema (lung barotrauma),
congenital spherocytosis (fragile RBCs), claustrophobia (anxiety), optic neuritis
(blindness), active cancer, pacemaker and pregnancy.
Possible Complications: One should be vigilant for possible complications of HBOT,
that includes barotrauma injury (to middle ear, nasal sinuses, inner ear, lung, teeth),
oxygen toxicity (central nervous system, lung), confinement anxiety, and ocular effects
(myopia, cataract growth) and seizures.

47.  Comprehensive
Neurorehabilitation
Neurorehabilitation is the clinical subspecialty that is devoted to the restoration and
maximization of functions that have been lost due to impairments caused by injury or
disease of nervous system. The goal of neurorehabilitation is to help patients with
impairments and disabilities and to make them functionally independent, which
requires team of rehabilitation specialists, such as nurses, physical therapists,
occupational therapists, speech therapist, psychologist and others.
Fig. 49.1: A pediatric Rehabilitation centre
Importance of Rehabilitation:
The rehabilitation team has a role to set short term goals (generally considered to be
two to three weeks) and long term goals (longer than 3 weeks) which should be
311
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
objective, measureable and time limited. Neurorehabilitation team has an
understanding of neural regulation of movement patterns. A framework for typical
motor behaviour is necessary to understand how motor behaviour is altered in persons
with neurological dysfunction and how plastic properties of nervous system interact
to produce change. Motor control is the study of how an individual controls
movements already acquired. Neuroplasticity is defined as brain's ability to adapt or
use cellular adaptations to learn or relearn functions which are previously lost as
result of cellular death by trauma or disease at any age. Neuronal sprouting is thought
to be primary mechanism, allowing injured neurons, to reconnect in new ways and
allowing intact undamaged neurons to form new connection and to enhance function.
Motor learning will continue throughout life as long as environment asks for change
and CNS has pliability and desire to learn. The rehabilitation team promotes this
learning and facilitates neural plasticity.
The philosophic foundation of rehabilitation team is to promote purposeful activity
thereby preventing dysfunction and eliciting maximum adaptation. These goal-
oriented activities are meant to be culturally meaningful and important to the needs
of patient and their families. Activities include daily life and work skills, exercise,
recreation and crafts. Exercise tasks in animal models, have shown that specifically
skilled type of exercises lead to increased angiogenesis in damaged cortical areas
whereas unskilled activities did not show this positive change. It is believed that in
humans too rehabilitation techniques would enhance neuroplastic changes.
How rehabilitation augments the effects of stem cell therapy
The concept of Neuro Regenerative Rehabilitation Therapy (NRRT) at NeuroGen
promotes a multidisciplinary and holistic approach to bring about recovery of neural
function with a close integration of Neuro regenerative (including stem cell therapy),
Neuro protective (medications) and neurorehabilitative therapies (physical /
occupational / speech/ psychological). Thus, it combines the best neurobiological
repair technologies and neurorestorative techniques. The rehabilitation protocol is
then individualized to the specific requirements of each patient emphasizing on
functional recovery and independence in ADL. The rehabilitation team sets up goals
and the injected stem cells from within the body help in achieving those goals. Studies
have shown that exercise induces mobility in the injected stem cells, thereby enhancing
the achievable outcomes. Hence, neurorehabilitation appears to work complimentarily
with stem cells therapy.
Studies have suggested that the combination of bone marrow stem cell therapy and
exercise training result in significant functional improvement in neurological disorders.
Neurorehabilitation facilitates neural plasticity and improves neural connectivity. It
stimulates neurons to function at their optimum capacity. It also activates the local
resident stem cells to help repair the damaged areas. Similarly exercise also stimulates
the injected stem cells and guides them towards their targeted functions. It helps the
regenerated cells to gain maximum function. Neurorehabilitation has also been
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
312
postulated to release growth factors, improve oxygenation and increase blood supply.
Thus, the synergistic effect of stem cell therapy and neurorehabilitation brings about
maximum benefits.
Physical therapy
As an important member of rehabilitation team a, physical therapist has a crucial role
to play which includes, bed mobility, ambulation and transfer activities like ,transfers
from bed to chair or from chair to commode or from wheelchair to car and so on.
Their assessments emphasize measures of voluntary movement, sensory appreciation,
ROM, strength, balance, fatigability, mobility, gait and functional status.

Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
Occupational Therapy
Occupational Therapists bring expertise to the rehabilitation team in enhancing the
independence and personal satisfaction of patients in their activities of daily living
(ADL), community and leisure activities, social integration, and work performance.
They play integral part in evaluating the need for a range of assistive devices and
training patients to make them independent in eating, dressing, bathing combing
and other ADL.
In the patient's home and workplace, the therapist provide grab bars, rails, ramps,
environmental controls, computer interfaces, architectural changes such as widening
a doorway to allow wheelchair access and emergency remote-control calling systems.
Along with the physical and recreational therapist, occupational therapist seek out
the environmental, personal, and activity-specific equipment and technologies that
enhance the quality of life of patients
Success in retraining during rehabilitation depends on diverse variables that include
the characteristics of a task, changing contexts and environments when performing a
task, psychological reinforcements including positive contextual factors like
motivation, attention, memory for carryover of what is taught and negative contextual
factors like environmental distractions, anxiety, sleep deprivation and family support
play a significant role.

Psychology
The word psychology is derived from the Greek words Psyche (which means soul)
and logos (which means study). Hence, psychology could be defined as a "study of
the soul". However, today it is defined as the scientific study of the behaviour of
individuals and their mental processes (American Psychological Association).
Neuropsychological testing and evaluation is to identify the pattern of cognitive,
behavioural, and emotional strengths and weaknesses and to provide specific
treatment recommendations or clarify diagnostic questions. The domains and tests

Psychological Counseling:
The purpose of counseling is to broadly empower the client to cope with life situations,
to reduce emotional stress, to engage in growth producing activity, to have
meaningful interpersonal relationships and to make effective decisions. Counseling
increases the control over present circumstances and enhances present and future
opportunities.
There are several main broad systems of psychotherapy:
i)
Psychoanalytic: It encourages the verbalization of all the patient's thoughts,
including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst
formulates the nature of the unconscious conflicts which are causing the patient's
symptoms and character problems.
ii)
Behaviour Therapy: This focuses on changing maladaptive patterns of behavior
to improve emotional responses, cognitions, and interactions with others.
iii)
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Seeks to identify maladaptive cognition,
appraisal, beliefs and reactions with the aim of influencing destructive negative
emotions and problematic dysfunctional behaviours.
iv)
Psychodynamic: Primary focus is to reveal the unconscious content of a client's
psyche in an effort to alleviate psychic tension.
v)
Existential Therapy: This is based on the existential belief that human beings
are alone in the world. This isolation leads to feelings of meaninglessness, which
can be overcome only by creating one's own values and meanings.
vi)
Humanistic: The task of Humanistic therapy is to create a relational environment
where this the self-actualizing tendency might flourish.
vii) Transpersonal Therapy: Addresses the client in the context of a spiritual
understanding of consciousness.
ix)
Body Psychotherapy: Addresses problems of the mind as being closely correlated
with bodily phenomena, including a person's sexuality, musculature, breathing
315
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
habits, physiology etc. This therapy may involve massage and other body exercises
as well as talking.
Play Therapy, Gestalt Therapy, Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy, Solution
based therapies and Reality Therapy some other forms of psychotherapy.
Speech therapy:
Speech therapy focuses on receptive language, or the ability to understand words
spoken and expressive language or the ability to express. It also deals with the
mechanics of producing words, such as articulation, fluency and voice. Speech therapy
also deals with rehabilitation of language in children who do not speak congenitally
due to hearing impairment, mental retardation, autism or attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder.
Speech and language therapy is beneficial in neurogenic disorders of non - progressive
and progressive origin.
i)
Aphasia: Aphasia is defined as loss of reception or expression of language as a
result of brain stroke. It can be classified as Broca's aphasia (patient presents
with intact comprehension with affected expression), Wernicke's (patient presents
with affected comprehension with jargon speech), Anomia or nominal aphasia
(patient presents with naming difficulties).
Recovery from aphasia depends on many prognostic factors like age, site and
extent of lesion, concomitant problems and time lapsed between the stroke and
initiation of therapy. Rehabilitation in aphasia focuses on the following:
a)
Improving auditory comprehension using pointing tasks "point to the spoon".
b)
Encouraging verbal utterances voluntarily.
c)
Improving sentence formation.
d)
Improving naming
A study done on aphasics concluded that combination of two inout channels -
auditory plus visual, auditory plus gestural may facilitate better comprehension
and performance by the patient
Many of the cases of do not improve with traditional speech and language. In
such cases, nonverbal modalities can be used to augment or alternate patient's
communication. The most commonly used AAC are communication boards,
gestures and use of written modality.
According to Collins (1986), severly aphasic patient may rely more on pictures
for basic need that cannot be readily expressed by pointing or natural gesturing
(as cited in Davis,2000) (5)
ii)
Dysarthria: The literal definition of dysarthria is disordered utterance (dys means
disordered or abnormal; arthria means to utter distinctly). A more comprehensive
definition is that dysarthria is the impaired production of speech because of
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
316
disturbances in the muscular control of the speech mechanism (as cited in Freed,
2000). Dysarthria can be classified as spastic dysarthria (due to upper motor
neuron lesion), flaccid dysarthria (due to lower motor neuron involvement),
ataxic dysarthria (due to cerebellar involvement), hypokinetic and hyperkinetic
dysarthria (due to basal ganglionic involvement) and mixed dysarthria.
Common causes of dysarthria are stroke, motor neuron disorder, multiple
sclerosis, head injury and Parkinson's disease to name a few.
Most of the patients with dysarthria present with inability to produce sounds
clearly, reduced loudness and monotonous or robotic speech. In cases of flaccid
and spastic dysarthria, oro - motor structures and functions are restricted.
Treatment of dysarthria depends on the severity of speech problem. Speech and
language pathologist aim to improve speech intelligibility (overall clarity of
speech) by:
a)
PNF (proprioceptive and neuromuscular facilitation).
b)
Improving loudness levels.
c)
Improving articulatory precision by using exaggerated consonants.
iii)
Apraxia: According to Darley (1969), apraxia is an articulatory disorder resulting
from impairment, as a result of brain damage of the capacity to program the
positioning of speech musculature and the sequencing of muscle movement for
the volitional production of phonemes. No significant weakness, slowness, or
incoordination in reflex  and automatic acts is seen (as cited in Freed, 2000).
Treatment of apraxia of speech involves phonemic drills, giving proprioceptive
and kinesthetic cues to the patients. MIT (melodic intonation therapy) is another
technique used (as cited in Freed, 2000).
Darley (1975) stated that the goal of treating apraxia of speech is to help patients
relearn the motor sequences needed to produce phonemes accurately.
iv)
Dysphagia: Dysphagia means disordered swallowing. Swallowing disorders
occur in all age groups from newborns to the elderly, and can occur as a result
of CVA, presence of tumors and/ or progressive neurologic conditions.
Swallowing consists of 4 stages namely oral preparatory, oral, pharyngeal and
esophageal stage. Depending upon the stage affected, a swallowing therapist
needs to make a judgement on the treatment modality.
A swallowing therapist aims to work on:
a)
strengthening the oral and pharyngeal structures for swallowing.
b)
modify the bolus in order to facilitate adequate swallowing.
c)
recommend postures and maneuvers like chin tuck/ chin down postures
according to the nature of disorder. During swallowing therapy, the
therapist should ensure airway safety and rule out any silent aspiration.
Children with autism, cerebral palsy, hearing impairment or mental
317
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
retardation present with either absence of speech or deficient speech and
language skills as compared to their age. The main aim of the speech therapist
is to bridge the gap between the chronological age and the language age of
the child. The speech and language pathologist tries to explore the areas
which the child would respond in and facilitate  communication within
child's impairment. Most widely used techniques for language learning are
repetitions, modeling utterances, expanding a topic and role play. However,
children with higher grade of severity may have to rely on alternative and
augmented communication (AAC) in order to reduce the communicative
burden on the caregivers.

48. Recent Advances in Neurosurgery
Modern Neurosurgical facilities have made the cures for serious Brain and Spine
problems safer and more definitive. We now have better results with fewer
complications, total cures, lower risks, lesser discomfort and shorter and lesser
treatments. The modern neurosurgical advances include better and more specific
pre-operative investigations more precise surgery in the form of micro-neuro surgery,
minimally invasive surgery, and advanced technological assistance. The post-operative
care has been improved by sophisticated intensive care monitoring and treatments.
For conditions, where neurological deficits persists despite all medical and surgical
interventions there is now the availability of stem cell therapy and aggressive neuro-
rehabilitation. Together all of these, have resulted in significantly better outcomes in
the present as compared to what the results were several years ago.
The recent advances in neurosurgery may be divided into following :
1)
Micro neurosurgery
2)
Minimally invasive neurosurgery
319
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
a)
Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery
b)
Neuroendoscopy
c)
Interventional Neuroendovascular treatment
d)
Radiosurgery
3)
Neuromodulation and Neurostimulation
4)
Advanced Spinal Surgery
Microneurosurgery
The availability of sophisticated operating microscope which have high magnification,
have resulted in more accurate, refined and safer neurosurgery since the visualization
of vital brain structures as well as normal areas is significantly enhanced. There is
less blood loss as well as less damage to normal structures. The following procedures
are now regularly done with the operating microscope. Large as well as difficult to
access tumours are now much more easily resected through microneurosurgery. These
include malignant as well as benign tumours.
A few examples of micro neurosurgery are shown below in pictures :
Brain Tumour surgery
Brain tumors may be malignant or benign and when they are large need to be removed
without causing damage to the surrounding normal brain. Microneurosurgery has
made this possible now with good overall results. People can lead normal lives after
major brain tumor surgery.

Vascular Surgery
Aneurysms and Arteriovenous malformations can rupture and cause intra-cranial
hemmorhage and therefore need to be treated. The 2 options are:
Microsurgical clipping for aneurysms/Excisions of AVMs or interventional coiling.

Endareterectomy) effectively reduces the relative risk of stroke by 55% in patients
with more than 70% carotid stenosis and by 35% in patients with stenosis between
50% and 69%. The surgery involves opening the carotid artery and removal of the
plague. Interventional stenting is also an option if the stenosis is not very severe.

326
Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery
This includes neuroendoscopy, stereotactic surgery, interventional endovascular
therapy and radiosurgery
Neuroendoscopy
Neuroendoscopy involves the surgical treatment of disorders of the brain and the
spine, using keyhole techniques and the use of specially designed endoscopes. There
are three main areas where neuroendoscopy can be used. These are for intraventicular
lesions and the treatment of hydrocephalus, surgical excision of pituitary tumors,
spinal surgery in cases of prolapsed discs removal.Brain tumors and lesions within
the ventricles can be removed with an endoscope through a small hole instead of
opening the whole skull through a craniotomy. A major indication for intraventicular
endoscopy is in the management of selected cases of hydrocephalus. The conventional
treatment of the same involves the operation of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. This
has many complications such as blockages and infections. Endoscopic cranial base
Surgery for tumors on the base of the skull can be removed through the nose, via the
endoscope in a stitch less surgery i.e. no external incisions are made. It is mainly
useful for pituitary tumors and occasionally other tumors such as angiofibromas and
clival chordomas. Complications are much less and patient can go home in 4 to 5
days.
Operating with the help of a neuroendsocope, surgery can be done through a small opening in the skull
instead of opening the entire skull.

Interventional endovascular therapy
Interventional therapy is done by passing a catheter from a puncture in the thigh and
sending it through the blood vessels all the way into the brain vessels. Similar to the
way angioplasty & similar procedures are done in cardiac patients. The Advantages
of Interventional therapy are that they are very significantly less complications as
compared to open surgery. Many cases that are untreatable by open surgery can be
treated with Interventional. Sometimes supplements open surgery and the hospital
stay is shorter.
The indications for Interventional therapy are :-
 •
Aneurysms of the brain
 •
AVM's in the brain
 •
Carotid artery stenosis / block
 •
Blockage of Intracranial blood vessels
 •
Vascular brain tumours

Radio Surgery
Radio Surgery is a treatment technique that use external radiation to treat certain
type of brain tumours and vascular malformations. There are 3 types of radio surgery
available :
[a]
Gama knife
[b]
X knife
[c]
Cyber knife
All these have comparable results but for specific indications one may be better than
the other. Since this is an external treatment , it is completely non-invasive and
therefore, totally safe. However its limitations are not all brain tumours can be treated
with radio surgery. Availability as well as high cost are also the limitations.
Neuromodulation & Neurostimulation
Neurostimulation is the implantation of electrodes into the brain or spinal cord along
with an internal pacemaker and an external handheld programmable device.
Neuromodulation and neurostimulation can be used for many conditions such as
intractable pain, Parkinsons disease, movement disorders, coma, spasticity, psychiatric
disorders, etc

Spine Surgery
Spine Surgery for degenerative spinal conditions, trauma, infections, etc has become
much safer and much effective due to two main reasons :-
a)
The availability of sophisticated instrumentation using titanium implants
b)
The possibility of minimal invasive spinal surgery
Decompression and Stabilization for the cranio vertebral junction

49. Stem Cell Therapy for
Incurable Neurological Disorders
Stem cell therapy has brought in a revolution in the field of medicine. Diseases, which
were thought to be incurable and untreatable, can now be treated, using stem cells
and cellular therapy.
What are stem cells?
Stem cells are building blocks of our body. These are very special cells, which have
special properties, which make them useful tools for healing or regenerating tissues
which are lost.
Fig. 46.1: Mechanism of action of stem cells
339
Neurological Disorders – A Handbook for Family Physicians
These properties are: ability to multiply manifold and also convert into specific cells
types depending on environmental cues.
Stem cells are of different types and potencies, depending on where they are taken
from.
Types of Stem Cells:
Embryonic stem cells are derived from IVF clinics, from  3-4 days old embryos.
These are most potent,but have ethical issues surrounding there use.Side effects include
potential teratoma formation. (We donot use embryonic stem cells at Neurogen BSI)
Umbilical cord blood derived stem cells and stem cells from placental tissue are also
a rich source.
Adult stem cells derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, dental pulp, etc, are the
most used in clinical practice. They have no ethical issues or controversies, are safe
for use (especially if used for the same patient) and efficient. (At Neurogen BSI, we
only use autologous adult stem cells)
What disorders/diseases can stem cell treat?
 NeuroGen Brain and Spine institute, now has  an experience of treating over 2700
patients with incurable neurological disorders, such as cerebral palsy, autism, mental
retardation, brain stroke/paralysis, head injury, cerebellar ataxia/atrophy, cerebral
atrophy, dementia, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, genetic neurological
disorders, neuromuscular disorders, etc.
How is stem cell therapy done?
The protocol of stem cell transplantation followed at NeuroGen BSI is MINIMALLY
INVASIVE, hence simple, safe and effective.About 100 ml of bone marrow is aspirated
from the anterior superior iliac spine ,mononuclear cells are purified/separated and
injected intrathecally .
In special cases, such as patients with muscular dystrophy, stem cells are also injected
intramuscularly.This is followed by an extensive holistic neurorehabilitation.
Refer Fig. 46.2- 46.4
What are the results of  stem cell therapy ?
Autism :
The improvements seen in 100 children with autism who underwent stem cell therapy.
Out of these 91% showed clinical improvements. These were reduction in abnormal
stereotypical behavior, reduction in self stimulatory behavior, improvement in eye
contact, attention span, speech, communication skills and social interactions.

Cerebral Palsy:
 In an analysis of 108 patients with maximum follow up of 4 years, stem cell therapy
was found to be safe and effective in 92.6% of the patients. Improvements were in
seen in symptoms like oromotor/speech, balance, trunk activity, upper limb activity,
lower limb activity, muscle tone, ambulation and activities of Daily Living .
Out of the 108 patients, 15.74% showed significant improvements, 48.14% of patients
showed moderate improvements and 28.7 % showed mild improvements.

Spinal cord injury:
Paraplegia :
110 thoracolumbar SCI patients who underwent  autologous bone marrow derived
mononuclear cells, intrathecally were assessed. On a mean follow up of 2 years ± 1
month, overall improvement was seen in 91% of patients, including reduction in
spasticity, partial sensory recovery, and improvement in trunk control, postural
hypotension, bladder management, mobility, activities of daily living, and functional
independence. A statistically significant association of these symptomatic

improvements with the cell therapy intervention was established. Some patients
showed a shift on the ASIA scale and changes in electrophysiological studies or
functional magnetic resonance imaging. No major side effects were noted.
Quadriplegia:
A detailed analysis of 50 chronic cervical SCI patients who underwent intrathecal
administration of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells followed by
neurorehabilitation,showed that on a mean follow up of 2 years ±1 month, 37 out of
50 (74%) showed improvements. Sensation recovery was observed in 26% cases,
improved trunk control in 22.4%, spasticity reduction in 20% and bladder sensation
recovery in 14.2%. All the 50 cases had improvement in postural hypotension. 12.24%
wheelchair bound patients started walking with assistance. Functionally, 20.4% patients
showed improved ADLs and 48% showed a positive. No major side effects were
noted in the duration of 2 years in both the studies. A better outcome was observed
in thoracolumbar injury as compared to the cervical injury suggesting that the level
of SCI greatly influences the recovery of the patient. Both studies demonstrated
statistically significant clinical and functional outcome.

Mental Retardation:
18 patients with mental retardation were administered with stem cell therapy. On a
mean follow up of 6 months, 70% cases showed improvement in toilet training, 64.29%
in home living, 60% in communication, 57.14% in self-care, 50% in cognition and
social skills amongst others. However, the improvements recorded were minimal as
majority of the patients belonged to the older age group. Hence, the results might
vary when children are treated at an early age.

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
A pilot study of 14 chronic TBI patients who underwent stem cell therapy was
conducted. These patients were followed up at 1 week, 3 months and 6 months after
the therapy. The outcome measures utilized were Functional Independence Measure
(FIM) scale, SF-8 Health Survey Scoring and Disability rating scale. At the end of 6
months, these scales showed a positive shift in scores. Improvements were observed
in various symptoms along with activities of daily living. Improvement in PET CT
scan performed before and 6 months after the intervention in 3 patients corresponded
to the clinical and functional improvements observed in these patients. The results of
this study suggest that stem cell therapy may promote functional recovery leading to
an improved quality of life in chronic TBI.

Stroke
24 patients diagnosed with chronic stroke were administered stem cell therapy,
followed by multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation. They were assessed on Functional
Independence Measure (FIM) objectively, along with assessment of standing and
walking balance, ambulation and hand function. A higher percentage of improvement
in all dimensions was observed in patients belonging to younger groups. Patients
who underwent stem cell therapy less than 2 years after the stroke showed better
changes. These results suggest that stem cell therapy may be a safe and effective
treatment approach in improving the functional outcomes in the chronic stage of
stroke.

Motor Neuron Disease (MND)
A total of 46 ALS patients underwent stem cell therapy. A detailed analysis was
conducted to compare the survival duration of these patients with 20 patients that
did not undergo stem cell therapy. Both patient groups shared similar baseline
demographics. The comparison was carried out using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
and suggested that the mean survival duration of the patients treated with stem cell
therapy (104.069 +/- 10.985 months) was longer than those who were not treated

(57.38 +/- 5.31 months) (Table 1). The difference between the two groups was
statistically significant (p=0.43). We also noted that patients who were given Lithium
and were young had better survival than the others. This could be attributed to
better survival and growth of the transplanted cells. Hence, this study suggests that
in addition to the standard treatment with Riluzole and neurorehabilitation, there is
a possibility that early intervention with combination of stem cell therapy and Lithium
may have a positive effect on the duration of survival in ALS.

Conclusion
Stem cell therapy is the new hope for many incurable neurological disorders. The use
of Autologous adult stem cells is completely safe and there are no serious side effects.
The procedures are minimally invasive and so there is no risk factor. The patients
show significant clinical and functional improvements and investigations such as PET
CT Scans , MRis , EMG /NCV etc also show objective evidence of the improvements.
Children with autism, cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy show the best results.
Adults with brain stroke, spinal cord injury, and head injury also show very good
results. There are many scientific international and national papers in medical journals
that have documented the safety and effectiveness of stem cell therapy in various
neurological disorders. In can therefore be concluded that for those patients suffering
from serious neurological disabilities, both physical and intellectual, this new therapy
is definitely worth considering.

Welcome to the study of clinical and therapeutic nutrition. Clinical nutrition, as a study 
focuses on the nutritional management of individuals or group of individuals with established 
disease condition. Clinical nutrition deals with issues such as altered nutritional requirements 
associated with the disease, disease severity and malnutrition and many such issues. Nutrition 
is an integral part of the medical therapy as adequate nutrition support can go a long way in 
improving quality of care and improving patient's medical outcome. The importance of 
nutrition in the prevention of illness and disease has been long recognized. So let us get to 
know more about clinical and therapeutic nutrition. 
 
 
DIETETICS AND ROLE OF DIETITIAN IN HEALTH CARE 
 
As a student of nutrition it must be evident to you by now that the diet and the food we eat 
have a direct and significant impact on our health. 
 
Eating a healthy balanced diet improves the quality of our life, whereas a poor diet may lead 
to morbidity and disease. The branch of medicine concerned with how food and nutrition 
affects human health comprising the rules to be followed for preventing, relieving or curing 
disease by diet is called Dietetics. Dietetics deals with feeding individuals based on the 
principles of nutrition. In fact, dietetics is the science and art of human nutritional care. 
 
Clinical Dietetics is the application of dietetics in a hospital or health care institutional 
setting. Clinical dietetics focuses on individual nutrition support and symptom management. 
You may come across the terms diet therapy, therapeutic diets while studying about clinical 
dietetics. Let us get to understand these terminologies used in the context of dietetics. 
 
Diet therapy is a branch of dietetics concerned with the use of food for therapeutic purpose. 
Diet therapy is a broad term used for the practical application of nutrition as a preventive or 
corrective treatment of a disease. It concerns with recovery from illness by giving good diet 
and prevention of disease. It may involve the modification of the existing dietary lifestyle to 
promote optimum health. The principles of diet therapy are to: 
 
• 
maintain good nutritional status, 
• 
correct deficiencies or disease, if any, 
• 
provide rest to the body, 
 
• 
help metabolize the nutrients, and 
 
• 
make changes in body weight, when necessary. 
 
Diet therapy may include prescribing specialized dietary regimes or meal plans. These 
specialized diet regimens or meal plans are called therapeutic diets. Therapeutic diet refers to 
a meal plan that controls the intake of certain foods or nutrients. They are adaptation of the 
normal, regular diet. Some common examples of therapeutic diets include clear liquid diet, 
diabetic diet, renal diet, gluten free diet, low fat diet, high fibre diet etc. Therapeutic diets are 
usually prescribed by dietitians, nutritionists or physicians. 
 
Role of Dietitian in Nutrition Care 
 
Dietitian you know is an expert in dietetics, dealing with human nutritional care. A dietitian 
applies the science and principals of human nutrition to help people understand the 
relationship between food and health and make appropriate dietary choices to attain and 
maintain health and to prevent and treat illness and disease. 
 
 
Dietitians work in a wide variety of roles in, for example, a clinical, public health or 
community, food service, administrative, freelance/consultancy, research or teaching 
capacity. However, you will find that majority of dietitians are clinical dietitians working in 
hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities or specialized institutes/units to 
provide nutritional care to patients with a variety of health conditions, and provide dietary 
consultations to patients and their families. The activities most likely to be undertaken by the 
clinical dietitians would include: 
 
 Collecting, organizing and assessing data relating to health
 
 
and nutritional status of individuals, groups and 

communities,
 
 
Review and analyze patients’ nutritional needs and goals to

make appropriate dietary recommendations,
 
 
Develop and implement nutrition care plans and monitor, follow up
 
 
and evaluate these plans and take corrective measures wherever 

required,
 Calculate nutritional value of food/meals planned,

 
 
Prescribe therapeutic diets and special nutrition support and feeding
                  regimens,
 
 
Oversee the preparation of special diets, special nutrition formulas for patients who 
are critically or terminally and require special feeding
 

through oral, enteral or parenteral routes,
 
 Plan and prepare basic menus and assist in supervising food service personnel in
 
preparing menus and serving of meals,

 Schedule work assignments in the dietary unit to facilitate the effective operation of 
the
 
CHAPTER 2: THERAPEUTIC DIETS 
 
Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
1. Enumerate the scope of dietetics and the role of dietitian in health care, 
2. Explain the diets of altered consistencies, 
3. Discuss the adaptation of normal diet to therapeutic diets, and 
 
 
 
Therapeutic diet is a qualitative/quantitative modified version of a normal regular diet which 
has been tailored to suit the changing nutritional needs of patient/individual and are used to 
improve specific health/disease condition. It is a planned diet used to supplement the medical 
or surgical treatment. 
 
 
Balanced diet is defined as one which contains a variety of foods in such quantities and 
proportions that the need for energy, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats and other nutrients is 
adequately met for maintaining health and well being 
 
 
Refer to Figure 1.1 which illustrates routine hospital diets. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.1: Routine hospital diets 
 
Normal or general diet in a hospital setting is a balanced diet which meets the nutritional 
needs of an individual/patient. It is given when the individual's medical condition does not 
warrant any specific modification. Most hospitals follow simple dietary recommendations 
(given by ICMR(Indian council for Medical Research) for Indian population) while planning 
the general diet. It is planned keeping the basic food groups in mind so that optimum amount 
of all nutrients is provided. Further, since the patient is hospitalized or on bed rest, reduction 
of 10% in energy intake should be made. The diet provides approximately 1600 to 2200Kcal, 
and contain around 180 to 300g carbohydrates, 60 to 80g of fat and 40 to 70 g of protein. 
 
Figure 1.1 also illustrates the soft diet and the liquid diets which are examples of therapeutic 
diet. In addition to these there may be other modified diets which individuals may require as 
part of their therapeutic needs. The reasons for modifying the diets may include: 
 
• 
For essential or lifesaving treatment: For example in celiac disease, providing 
gluten free diet, 
 
• 
To replete patients who are malnourished because of disease such as cancer and 
intestinal diseases by providing a greater amount of a nutrient such as protein, 
 
• 
To correct deficiencies and maintain or restore optimum nutritional status, 
 
 
• 
To provide rest or relieve an affected organ such as in gastritis, 
 
• 
To adjust to the body's ability to digest, absorb, metabolize or excrete: For 
example, a low fat diet provided in fat malabsorption, 
 
• 
To adjust to tolerance of food intake. For example, in case of patients with cancer 
of esophagus tube feeding is recommended when patients cannot tolerate food by 
mouth, 
 
• 
To exclude foods due to food allergies or food intolerance, 
 
• 
To adjust to mechanical difficulties, for example for elderly patients with denture 
problems, changing the texture/consistency of food recommended due to 
problems with chewing and/or swallowing, 
 
• 
To increase or decrease body weight/body composition when required, for 
example as in the case of obesity or underweight, 
 
• 
As helpful treatment, alternative or complementary to drugs, as in diabetes or in 
hypertension 
 
 
Types of Dietary Adaptations for Therapeutic Needs 
 
A diet may need to be altered and adjusted in many ways before it meets the therapeutic 
needs of an individual patient. These adaptations may include: 
 
• 
Change in consistency of foods, such as liquid diet, soft diet, low fibre diet, high 
fibre diet. 
 
• 
Increase or decrease in energy value of the diet such as low calorie diet for weight 
reduction, high calorie diet for burns. 
 
• 
Increase or decrease in specific nutrients or type of food consumed, such as 
sodium restricted diet, lactose restricted diet, high fibre diet, high potassium diet. 
 
• 
Elimination of spices and condiments, such as bland diets. 
 
• 
Omission of specific foods such as allergy diets, gluten free diet. 
 
• 
Adjustment in the ratio and balance of proteins, fats and carbohydrate such as 
diabetic diet, renal diet and cholesterol-lowering diets. 
 
• 
Test diets: These are single meals or diets lasting one or few days that are given to 
patients in connection with certain tests e.g. the fat absorption test used to 
determine if steatorrhea is present. 
 
• 
Change in frequency of meals, feeding intervals, re-arrangement of the number 
and frequency of the meals such as diabetic diet, diet for peptic ulcer disease.
Remember, normal nutrition is the foundation upon which the therapeutic modifications are 
made. The various dietary adaptations for therapeutic needs are briefly highlighted here. 
 
A. Diets of Altered Consistency 
 
Therapeutic diets are modified for consistency, texture to fit the nutritional needs. Some 
individuals may require a clear liquid diet, while others a fully liquid diet or soft diet based 
on their medical condition. Figure 1.2 illustrates the modified diets based on consistency. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.2: Modifications in consistency 
 
a) Liquid Diet consists of foods that can be served in liquid or strained form in room 
temperature. They are usually prescribed in febrile states, postoperatively i.e. after 
surgery when the patient is unable to tolerate solid foods. It is also used for individuals 
with acute infections or digestive problems, to replace fluids lost by vomiting, diarrhoea. 
The two major types of liquid diets include - Clear liquid diet and full liquid/fluid diet. 
 
i) 
Clear liquid diet provides foods and fluids that are clear and liquid at room 
temperature. The purpose of the clear liquid diet is to provide fluids and electrolytes 
to prevent dehydration. It provides some amount of energy but very little amount of 
other nutrients. It is also deficient in fibre. Hence it is nutritionally inadequate and 
should be used only for short periods i.e. 1-2 days. 
 
Examples of clear liquid diet: Water, strained fruit juices, coconut water, lime juice 
(nimbu pani), whey water, barley/arrowroot water, rice kanji, clear dal soup, strained 
vegetable or meat soup, tea or coffee without milk or cream, carbonated beverages, 
ice pops, plain gelatin are some examples of clear liquid diet. 
 
ii) 
Full liquid diet provides food and fluids that are liquid or semi liquid at room 
temperature. It is used as a step between a clear liquid diet and a regular diet. The 
purpose of the full liquid diet is to provide an oral (by mouth) source of fluid for 
individuals who are incapable of chewing, swallowing or digesting solid food. It 
provides more calories than the clear liquid diet and gives adequate nourishment, 
except that it is deficient in fibre. It is indicated for post-operative patients and for 
gastrointestinal illness. The nutritive content of the full liquid diet can be increased by 
using protein, vitamin and fibre supplements. 
 
Examples of full liquid diet: Foods allowed or included in a full liquid diet include 
beverages, cream soups, vegetable soups, daal soups, strained food juices, lassi/butter 
 
 
milk, yogurt, hot cocoa, coffee/tea with milk, carbonated beverages, cereal porridges 
(refined cereals) custard, sherbet, gelatin, puddings, ice cream, eggnog, margarine, 
butter, cream (added to foods), poached, half boiled egg etc. 
 
 
b) Soft diet as the name suggests provides soft whole food that is lightly seasoned and are 
similar to the regular diet. The term 'soft' refers to the fact that foods included in this type 
of diet are soft in consistency, easy to chew and made of simple, easily digestible foods. It 
does not contain harsh fibre or strong flavors. It is given during acute infections, certain 
gastrointestinal disorders and at the post-operative stage to individuals who are in the 
early phase of recovery following a surgery. The soft diet provides a transition between a 
liquid and a normal diet i.e. during the period when a patient has to give up a full liquid 
diet but is yet not able to tolerate a normal diet. Soft diet can be nutritionally adequate 
(providing approximately 1800-2000 calories, 55-65g protein) provided the patient is able 
to consume adequate amount of food. 
 
Examples of soft diet: A soft diet freely permits the use of cooked vegetables, soft raw 
fruits without seeds, broths and all soups, washed pulses in the form of soups and in 
combination of cereals and vegetables (like khichri, dalia), breads and ready-to-eat 
cereals (most preferable refined such as poha, upma, pasta, noodles etc.), milk and milk 
beverages, yogurt, light desserts (including kheer, halwa, custard, jelly, ice cream), Egg 
and tender and minced, ground, stewed meat and meat products, fat like butter, cream, 
vegetable oil and salt and sugar in moderation. Foods to be best avoided in the soft diet 
include coarse cereals, spicy highly seasoned and fried foods, dry fruits and nuts, rich 
desserts. 
 
c) Bland Diet: A bland diet is made of foods that are soft, not very spicy and low in fiber. It 
consists of foods which are mechanically, chemically and thermally non-irritating i.e. are 
least likely to irritate the gastrointestinal tract. Individuals suffering from gastric or 
duodenal ulcers, gastritis or ulcerative colitis are prescribed this diet. 
 
Foods Included: Milk and milk products low in fat or fat free; Bread, pasta made from 
refined cereals, rice; cooked fruits and vegetables without peel and seeds; Eggs and lean 
tender meat such as fish, poultry that are steamed, baked or grilled; Cream, butter; 
Puddings and custards, clear soups. 
 
Foods Avoided: Fried, fatty foods; Strong flavored foods; Strong tea, coffee, alcoholic 
beverages, condiments and spices; High fiber foods; hot soups and beverages; whole 
grains rich in fiber; strong cheeses. 
 
 
B. Modification in Quantity 
 
Depending on the clinical condition some individuals may require a restriction diet such 
as sodium restricted diet (as in high blood pressure), purine restricted diet (as in gout) or 
low residue diet (prescribed and/or before abdominal surgery) designed to reduce the 
frequency and volume of fecal output. Sometimes a complete elimination diet may be 
recommended when there is food intolerances or complete insensitivity to a particular 
food such as a gluten free diet or a dairy free diet or nut free diet etc. Occasionally an 
increase in the amount of a specific dietary constituent may be prescribed such as a high 
 
 
potassium diet or a high fibre diet (as in constipation) or an iron-rich diet (as in anemia) 
when the clinical condition demands. 
 
 
C. Modification in Nutrient (Proteins, Fat, Carbohydrate) Content The nutrient content 
of the diet is modified to treat deficiencies, change body weight or control diseases such 
as hypertension or diabetes. You may have come across patients with high blood sugar 
levels, being prescribed a diabetic diet which requires changes in the quantity and type of 
carbohydrates included in each meal. Refined carbohydrates (such as sugar, honey, 
refined flour, semolina etc.) are best avoided and use of complex carbohydrates (whole 
wheat flour, coarse cereals etc.) recommended. Patients with heart diseases require a fat 
controlled low cholesterol diet while patients with renal (kidney) failure and advanced 
liver diseases a low protein diet, patients with HIV disease, cancer or malnourished a high 
protein, high calorie diet. Others as in the case of overweight, obesity a weight reduction 
diet, low in fat and calories. 
 
 
D. Changes in Meal Frequency 
 
Individuals suffering with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) stand to benefit by 
consuming small but frequent meals. 5 to 6 small meals instead of three regular meals are 
recommended. 
 
E. Changes in Method of Cooking 
 
Leaching is indicated for cooking vegetables for people with chronic kidney diseases 
because the kidney's no longer maintains the ideal level of potassium necessary for 
optimum health. Leaching (soaking in water) drains out excessive potassium and 
phosphorous from the vegetables. In elderly people food may be modified by mechanical 
processing such as mashing, blending or chopping. For patients on bland diet foods 
steamed, baked or grilled are recommended. A review on the methods of cooking is 
presented for your understanding at the end of the book. 
 
 
F. Modification in the Method of Feeding 
 
To provide adequate nutrition, normally oral feeding (by mouth) is recommended. 
Sometimes oral feeding is not possible, under such circumstances special feeding 
methods such as enteral feeding (provision of liquid formula diet delivered via 
nasogastric feeding tube) and parenteral feeding (fluids containing water, glucose, amino 
acids, minerals, vitamins given through the peripheral and central veins) is recommended.

Chapter 3: NUTRITION AND INFECTION 
 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
1. Discuss the interaction between nutrition and infection, 
 
2. Describe the effect of infection on nutritional status, 
3. Discuss how malnutrition can lead to infection, 
 
 
 
The role of nutrition in disease prevention and health management is well established. Also 
you are aware that poor nutrition can lead to ill health, disease and infections. Infections are 
caused by microorganisms which in turn can lead to malnutrition. Is there a link between 
these two conditions? In this section we shall discuss the interaction of infection and 
nutrition. 
 
 
Infection and malnutrition have always been intricately linked. Evidence suggests that 
common childhood infections exert their influence in precipitating malnutrition. The 
relationship between malnutrition, impaired immunity and infection can be described as a 
vicious cycle. We will learn about this vicious cycle in this chapter. 
 
THE CYCLE OF MALNUTRITION AND INFECTION 
 
Malnutrition, as you already know, is an impairment of health resulting from a deficiency or 
lack of food/nutrients or imbalance of nutrients in the diet. Almost any nutrient deficiency, if 
sufficiently severe, will impair resistance to infection. 
 
Let us understand this interaction between malnutrition and infection with the help of a case 
study. Raju, a 4-year-old boy, is suffering from infectious diarrhoea, caused by the invasion 
of the body by harmful microorganisms. The infection caused loose motion, fever, 
dehydration and impaired absorption. On further investigation he was also found to be 
suffering from protein energy malnutrition reflecting as loss of weight. Now, when these two 
diseases exist in the same person (here Raju) concurrently, the interaction between the two 
diseases usually alters the nature, behavior of the diseases. The overall clinical status of the 
child worsens often resulting in increased complications or increased duration of the disease 
and in some cases results in death. In case of Raju, infection is a common precipitating factor 
for malnutrition. Ironically, malnutrition is also a major factor in the occurrence of infection 
and the two interact, making each other worse. Figure 2.1 illustrates this interaction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.1: Interaction between infection and malnutrition 
 
 
An inadequate dietary intake, in case of Raju, led to weight loss, lowered immunity, mucosal 
injury, invasion by pathogens, and impaired growth and development as highlighted in Figure 
3.1. Raju's nutrition was further aggravated by diarrhea, malabsorption, loss of appetite, 
diversion of nutrients for the immune response, and urinary nitrogen loss, all of which lead to 
nutrient losses and further damage to defense mechanisms making him more susceptible to 
infections. This in turn led to further reduced dietary intake causing a vicious cycle of 
malnutrition and infection as highlighted in Figure 3.2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.2: The vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection 
 
So when infection aggravates malnutrition or malnutrition lowers resistance to infection, the 
relationship between the two can be described as Synergism i.e. the simultaneous presence of 
malnutrition and infection results in an interaction that is more serious for the individual than 
would be expected from the combined effect of the two working independently. 
 
The synergistic effect of malnutrition and infection often leads to a high rate of child deaths 
in poor households/communities in India. What generally happens is that in a poor rural/slum 
household a child is as such born with low birth weight (that is less than 2.5kg) because of 
inadequate dietary intake of the mother during pregnancy. Subsequently the child is solely 
breast fed for long periods (2 or more years). Complementary feeding (i.e. introduction of 
additional foods other than breastmilk) is delayed beyond 6 months of age. This triggers 
growth faltering that is the child's growth and development slows down resulting in weight 
loss. In other terms malnutrition sets in. Moreover, in view of the poor environment and lack 
of hygiene so common in rural/slum areas, the children are further exposed to infections like 
diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections. There is reduction in food intake by the child due to 
loss of appetite due to these infections. As a result, there is further slowing down of growth. 
The cumulative effect of dietary deficit and infection produces retardation of physical growth 
leading to stunting (short stature or low height/length for age as compared to normal child) in 
children. It is important to highlight here that the effects of stunting are long lasting. Children 
who are stunted grow up to be adults with reduced capacity to do physical work and are less 
economically productive. 
 
Effect of Malnutrition on Infection 
 
With reference to Figure 3.1 and 3.2, it must be evident to you that inadequate nutrient intake 
lowers immunity. Also it leads to mucosal damage. Let us get to know more on this aspect. 
 
a) Lowered Immunity: Immunity, in simple terms can be described as the state of being 
unsusceptible or being protected against a particular disease or illness by the presence 
of particular substance in the blood. These particular disease fighting substances are 
called antibodies. A healthy well-nourished child/individual is at a lower risk of 
infection. They can fight the infection because of the ability of these well-nourished 
individuals to produce these disease fighting substances called antibodies. But in case 
of malnourished individuals there is reduction in antibody production and therefore 
the disease fighting capacity is lowered making the individual more prone to 
infections. 
 
b) Effect on the integrity of skin and mucous membrane: Dietary inadequacy diminishes 
resistance to infection by reducing the integrity of various tissues. In a healthy well 
fed individual the skin, mucosal membrane and other tissues are healthy and prevent 
the entry of infectious agents. They act as a barrier and prevent the infection from 
entering the body. In an individual suffering from malnutrition, the protective 
mechanism is absent. The mucous membrane becomes readily permeable and 
provides a favorable environment for the growth of the infectious agent. 
Consequently, the individual will catch infection easily. 
 
 
Infection and Nutritional Status 
 
Infection, no matter how mild, has adverse effects on nutritional status. Nutritional status, as 
you may recall, refers to the condition of health of an individual as influenced by the 
utilization of the nutrients. So how does infection influence the utilization of the nutrients 
which in turn influences nutritional status? Let us understand. There can be multiple ways but 
the first and foremost effect of infection is on loss of appetite. 
 
 
a) Loss of Appetite: Do you recall the last time you were sick or down with some 
infection? What did you experience? Yes, you may not have been eager to consume 
food or were not able to tolerate food leading to loss of appetite. Further with use of 
medicines such as antibiotics to treat the infection your appetite may have been 
further affected leading to reduced food intake. Now if this condition would have 
been prolonged it would have led to consistent decrease in food intake leading to 
nutrient deficiency. 
 
 
b) Unfavorable cultural practices: One of the common practices in our country is to 
restrict or withdraw food from individuals when suffering from infection, particularly 
diarrhoea or respiratory infections. It is believed that solid foods, milk etc. be best 
avoided instead bland, starchy gruels low in nutritive value be provided to rest the 
digestive system. Such a practice is deleterious; particularly when the individual due 
to infection is already having low food intake and further reduction in the quality of 
diet contributes to nutrient deficiencies and thus leading to poor nutritional status. 
 
 
c) Decreased intestinal absorption: The main function of intestine is to digest, absorb 
and propel food along its length. During infection all these functions are affected. 
Infections cause's changes to the epithelial membrane leading to malabsorption. Any 
decrease in the absorption of nutrients can lead to deficiency. For example, in children 
suffering from infectious diarrhoea, protein absorption from intestine may reduce as 
much as 40%. Other evidence suggests that in children with acute diarrhoea and 
respiratory infections only 30 -70 per cent of ingested vitamin A is absorbed. Poor 
absorption thus leads to nutrient deficiency disorders influencing nutritional status. 
 
d) Worm/parasite infection: Also there are documented reports implicating intestinal 
worm/parasitic infections with poor nutritional status. Hookworm, round worm 
infection, amoebiasis, giardiasis is among the most common intestinal parasitic 
infections worldwide. These infections are associated with decreased child growth, 
loss of weight, chronic blood loss, iron deficiency anaemia, diarrhoea and stunted 
growth. 
 
e) Protein loss: In some infections and fevers, few nutrients, particularly proteins are 
excreted and lost from the body thus causing poor nutritional status. For example, 
diseases associated with diarrhoea, dysentery produce an average loss of 0.9g protein 
per kg body weight per day. Higher losses are observed with typhoid fever and other 
acute infections, reaching 1.2g protein/kg body weight/day. Such losses therefore 
contribute to increased requirement of protein during infection and fevers. 
 
 
From the discussion above it must be evident to you that the overall effect of the infections 
on the nutritional status is substantial. In the context of developing country like India, where 
large number of children, are already on a deficient diet and malnourished, the coexistence of 
infection in the same child is producing the effect that is beyond the summed effect expected 
from the two conditions acting alone.

 CHAPTER 4: METHODS OF COOKING  
  
Learning Objectives: 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
 
1. Describe different methods of cooking , 
2. Explain and ensure the nutritive values in various methods of cooking. 
 
 
Many foods are consumed as such in the raw state while some are cooked to make 
them edible. Food is being cooked as it tastes better Even vegetable and fruits are 
cooked to add variety to the diet and make them easily palatable, attractive and 
colorful. Cooking also kills many microorganism and makes the food safe to be 
consumed. Several raw foods have anti-nutritional factors which are destroyed by 
cooking. It also enhance the availability of some nutrients. 
 
 
Figure 4.1 Different methods of cooking 
 
Principles of cooking food 
 
 
1. Foods must be cooked in a way that it retains the original flavours. 
 
2. Sometimes the flavor of the food is drawn out into the gravy or broth. 
 
3. The preservation of the maximum nutritive value can be ensured by using the 
correct method of cooking. 
 
Cooking methods 
 
During cooking, heat may be transferred to the food by conduction, convection, 
radiation or by the energy of microwave-electronic heat transfer.

i) 
Moist Methods: These are the methods in which we use the heat generated by 
water in some form or the other. Some of the important ones are explained as 
follows: 
 
a) Boiling 
Foods are cooked by placing them in boiling water at 1000 C and 
maintain this temperature till the desired stage of cooking has been 
reached. Rice, pulses, potatoes are cooked this way. 
 
Advantages 
1. Simplest Method of cookery 
2. Boiling of food brings about uniform cooking of food 
 
3. At high temperatures protein content of food get denatured and 
embedded in food 
 
4. Starch gets gelatinized and collagen gets hydrolyzed. 
 
5. Boiling of foods aids in proper digestion 
 
Disadvantages 
1. The process of boiling takes time. 
2. When excess of water is used the water soluble nutrients are lost. 
3. Loss of minerals is also a big disadvantage with boiling. 
4. Boiling of food brings about its decoloration 
 
b) Pressure Cooking 
 
In this method the food is cooked under pressure and with increase in pressure 
the temperature also correspondingly increases. Thus the food is cooked very 
fast. Actually it is a type of steaming only, in which water is boiled under high 
pressure, thus raising the temperature and reducing the cooking time. 
 
Advantages 
1. Reduces cooking time. 
2. Fuel efficiency increased. 
3. Nutrient loss is less. 
4. Food is cooked properly and is made tender. 
 
5. The flavor and aroma of the food is trapped inside the cooker and is 
not lost. 
 
 
Disadvantages 
1. Long hours of pressure cooking make food soggy and too soft. 
2. Flavors of foods may make and individuality be lost. 
 
c) Steaming 
 
This method uses steam as the medium of cooking. The food is surrounded by 
steam and is cooked by the heat supplied from steam. Types of steaming are: 
 
• 
Dry steaming: The steam generated from double boiler is used for 
cooking food. Sauces and custards are made by this method. 
 
• 
Wet Steaming: Steam comes in direct contact with the food and cooks 
it. Dhokla and idli are made by this method. 
 
Advantages 
 
1. Constant stirring is not required. 
2. Nutritive value of food remains intact. 
3. Cooking time is less. 
4. No external is added which makes the food easily digestible. 
5. The flavor of the steamed food is good. 
 
Disadvantages 
1. Dhokla cooker and Idli makers are required. 
2. Special vessels are essential for steaming food. 
3. Limitation of the type of foods that can be cooked by this method. 
 
 
d) Poaching 
 
 
This method is generally used for eggs. This involves cooking in the minimum 
amount of liquid at a temperature of 80-85℃. Fish and fruits are also poached. 
 
Advantages 
1. Cooks food quickly. 
2. There is no addition of fat. 
3. The foods that are poached are better digestible. 
 
Disadvantages 
1. Water soluble nutrients leach into the water. 
2. The foods are generally bland in taste. 
 
e) Toasting 
 
Generally applied for bread slices which are browned from both sides by 
keeping them between two grilles. 
 
Advantages 
1. Improves color, flavor and texture of food. 
2. Roasted seeds are easy to grind. 
3. Roasting reduces the amount of moisture of foods 
 
 
 
Disadvantages 
1. A continuous vigil is required to prevent burning. 
2. Amino acids are lost while toasting. 
 
f) Baking 
 
The medium of cooking is hot air. A dry method of cooking, it combines 
steam which is generated while food is cooked. Cakes, custard, baked 
vegetables, bread, biscuit, pizzas are all baked food. 
 
Advantages 
1. Texture and flavor of foods are improved. 
2. Baking give rise to a variety of combination of dishes. 
3. Foods are cooked uniformly in an oven. 
 
Disadvantages 
1. An oven is required for baking. 
2. Over cooking results in the burning and scorching of food. 
 
g) 
Blanching 
Blanching is a cooking process wherein a food, usually a vegetable or fruit, is 
scalded in boiling water or oil, removed after a brief, timed interval, and 
finally plunged into iced water or placed under cold running water (shocking 
or refreshing) to halt the cooking process. 
 
Advantages 
1. Blanched dishes are healthy as there is minimal loss of nutrients 
because of the short cooking time.  
2. Blanching also enhances the color of green vegetables, and the time 
taken is also lesser than other moist heat cooking methods. 
 
Disadvantages 
1. Blanching cannot be used for every type of food item. 
2. Blanching often needs to be coupled with another cooking process so 
as to provide more flavor to the final dish.

CHAPTER -5: FEVERS (ACUTE&CHRONIC) 
 
(TYPES, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
 
1. Define the term fever and present the classification of fevers 
 
2. Differentiate between acute and chronic fevers 
 
3. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms and the metabolic changes during infection 
and fevers, and 
 
4. Describe diet therapy during fevers. 
 
 
 
 
In the previous Unit we looked at the interrelationship between nutrition and infections. You 
would realize that infection and fevers are coexistent. Fever is an outcome of infection. In this 
section we will also look at the basic concepts and inter-relationship between fever, infection and 
nutrition. A detail review on dietary management of fevers will be presented. 
 
FEVER: DEFINITION, CAUSES & SYMPTOMS 
 
Fever is classically defined as the abnormal condition of the body, characterized by undue rise in 
temperature, quickening of the pulse, and disturbance of various body functions. Surely, you 
must be aware of the normal body temperature. Yes, the normal human body temperature may 
range from 36oC to 37oC (98.6F). So, technically any body temperature above the normal 
temperature may be considered fever. What do you think? Well, in practice an individual is 
usually not considered to have a significant fever until the temperature is above 100.4 (38° C). 
 
It is important to understand that fever is not an illness but it is a symptom or an adaptive 
response of our body to a variety of conditions, such as infection, inflammation or unknown 
causes. Fever may be caused by a bacterial infection or by a virus or certain inflammatory 
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (inflammation of the lining of the joints) or a malignant 
tumor etc. 
 
As a child you may recall suffering from cold/cough and/or chest infection or diarrhoea, and very 
often these infections were accompanied by fever. The clinical and behavioral manifestations of 
fever besides elevated temperature you might have experienced included headache, muscle ache, 
chills and shivering, sweating, loss of appetite, irritability, general weakness, dehydration etc. 
 
 
Fever is, therefore, a sign that something out of the ordinary is going on in the body. Fever, in 
fact, is part of the body's own disease-fighting mechanism. A rise in body temperature is one of 
the ways our immune system attempts to combat an infection Fever helps defend against 
microbial (bacterial/viral) invasions and apparently is capable of killing or inhibiting the growth 
of some bacteria/viruses that can tolerate only a narrow temperature range. 
 
From our review so far we may then conclude that usually a rise in temperature helps the 
individual resolve an infection. So a mild fever i.e. above the normal body temperature but below 
100.4F (38° C) is probably helping to neutralize the bacteria or virus that is causing the infection. 
There is no need to worry. But sometimes fever may rise too high and can be severe and serious 
and lead to complications. Therefore it is important to learn about the classification, type and 
pattern of fever for appropriate management. 
 
 
FEVER: CLASSIFICATION AND TYPES 
 
Fevers are primarily classified into three categories: Acute, Sub-acute and Chronic fevers based 
on duration as highlighted in Figure 5.1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.1 Classification of fevers 
 
Acute fevers are those which are for less than 7 days in duration and are characteristics of 
infectious diseases such as malaria and viral-related upper respiratory tract infections. Sub-acute 
fevers are usually not more than 2 weeks in duration as can be seen in cases of typhoid fever. 
Chronic fever on the other hand are persistent, usually more than 2 week in duration 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
 
Basal Metabolic Rate is defined as the rate at which our body uses energy when we are resting 
in order to keep the vital body functions (such as breathing, heart beating etc.) going and are 
typical of chronic bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, viral infections like HIV, cancers etc. 
 
Further, based on the height of the body temperature, fevers can also be classified as low grade, 
moderate grade or high grade fever. You would notice that a low grade fever does not exceed 
37.80C and is present daily especially in the evening. Tuberculosis causes low grade fever. 
Similarly you may come across fever types described as continuous or sustained fever, 
intermittent fever and remittent fever. Continuous/sustained fever is defined as a fever that does 
not fluctuate more than about 1oC (1.5F) during 24h, but at no time touched normal. Continuous 
fevers are seen in pneumonia, typhoid, and urinary tract infection among others. Such fevers are 
characterized by slow step-wise temperature rise. Intermittent fever is defined as fever present 
only for several hours during the day. This pattern you may notice in malaria, tuberculosis or 
pyrogenic infections. Remittent fever, on the other hand, is defined as fever with daily 
fluctuations exceeding 2oC but at no time touched normal. This kind of fever is always 
associated with infectious diseases such as infective endocarditis, rickettsiae Infection. 
 
 
Having looked at the different types and classification of fever, we shall focus next on 
management of fevers, with special reference to dietary management. Diet, you would notice 
plays an important role in the management of fevers. With the rise in body temperature, (above 
normal), several metabolic changes occur in the body that increases the nutritional needs. A brief 
review on these changes is presented next. 
 
METABOLIC CHANGES DURING FEVER 
 
Fever is usually characterized by certain metabolic changes. Higher the temperature, longer 
the duration of the fever, more is the ill effect. The common effects include: 
 
 
 Increase in the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Note, there is a 13% increase in BMR with 
every 1°C rise in body temperature.(or 7% increase with every 1°C increase in 
temperature).

 Decreased glycogen stores and decreased stores of adipose (fat) tissue.

 Increased catabolism (breakdown) of proteins, especially in case of typhoid, malaria, 
tuberculosis fevers. This results in production of excess amount of nitrogenous wastes, 
which places an additional burden on the kidneys.

 Increased excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride etc. thought sweat, urine, vomiting 
leading to electrolyte imbalance.

 Accelerated loss of body fluid in the form of excessive sweat and urine formation.
 Loss of appetite which limits the food intake thus leading to weight loss.

 Decrease in the absorption of nutrients like proteins, vitamins, minerals.
 
 
 
The above changes accompanied by headache, muscle ache, chills and shivering, sweating, loss 
of appetite, irritability, general weakness, dehydration experienced during fever may have a 
significant effect on the nutritional status of the individual. Thus management of fever becomes 
critical. In the next section we shall look at the diet therapy for management of Fevers. We shall 
first consider the dietary management in sub-acute fever, followed by dietary therapy for chronic 
fever. 
 
 
DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF SUB-ACUTE FEVER 
 
Typhoid is a serious health threat in the developing world such as India, especially for children. 
We have already learnt that typhoid is a sub-acute continuous fever which can last for about two 
week’s duration. What is the cause of typhoid? Typhoid is caused by the Salmonella typhi 
bacteria, and is also called enteric fever because the bacteria or infection is found in the 
intestines. 
 
Typhoid fever spreads through contaminated food and water or occasionally through direct 
contact with someone who is infected. The mode of spread of this infection is, through fecal-oral 
route. Let us understand the concept of fecal-oral route here. Note, Salmonella typhi is passed in 
the feces and sometimes in the urine of infected people. The source of infection can be the 
drinking water or milk or any other food contaminated by intestinal contents (through faeces, 
urine) of the patient or by flies which transmit the disease. We can also contact the infection if 
we eat food handled by someone with typhoid fever who has not washed their hands carefully 
after using the toilet. 
 
A patient with typhoid will usually present with: 
 
 high fever, headache, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting

 gastrointestinal problems like abdominal pain and either diarrhoea or constipation.
 increased BMR

 massive loss of lean body mass (muscle) due to tissue (protein) breakdown leading 
to excessive nitrogen loss.

 significant decrease in glycogen and adipose tissue stores because of increased 
energy expenditure.

 excessive diarrhoea, vomiting leading to fluid and electrolyte losses.
 
 
Dietary management in Sub-acute fever 
 
The main objective of dietary management during sub acute fever is to: 
i) provide a nutritious diet to prevent malnutrition. 
ii) restore positive nitrogen balance and reduce the burden on kidneys 
iii) provide relief to symptoms as and when present. 
iv) correct and maintain water and electrolyte balance, and 
v) avoid irritation of intestinal tract as may occur in typhoid. 
 
 
Thus the dietary management will focus on providing a diet that contains high calories, proteins, 
carbohydrates and moderate fat. But very often the fever is accompanied by anorexia, vomiting, 
nausea. You would notice the patient has poor appetite moreover is unable to tolerate food. So, 
the diet has to be modified as per the patients’ tolerance. The texture of foods given would 
depend on the patient’s tolerance. Initially a liquid or full fluid diet may be provided for few 
days. As the person’s appetite improves a bland diet, low fibre soft diet may be given which is 
soothing and easy to digest. Slowly the person may be put on a normal diet. The idea is to 
encourage the patient to eat so as to meet the increased nutrient requirements. Feedings several 
times a day need to be encouraged. The nutrient needs during typhoid and how to meet them is 
the focus of discussion next. The information is summarized in Table 5.1.

DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC FEVER 
 
Tuberculosis (TB), you may be aware, is an example of chronic fever caused by bacteria - 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
 
The disease spreads from person to person through microscopic droplets released into the air by 
cough or spit or sneeze from a person with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis mainly affects the lungs 
but can get localized in other organs also, like lymph nodes, kidney, bone etc 
 
The most commonly observed form of tuberculosis in India is pulmonary tuberculosis. It is 
worthy to note that tuberculosis remains a major global health problem and is one of the top 10 
causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent. It is linked to poverty, under 
nutrition and poor immune function. 
 
When a person is infected with pulmonary tuberculosis, in a normal healthy individual, the 
immune system help fights the infection and the bacteria in the body are in an inactive state and 
the person shows no symptom. This is called latent tuberculosis. However, if the body's immune 
system is unable to fight the bacteria the disease becomes active and is contagious and can 
spread in the body and to other people. 
 
 
The association between TB and undernutrition has long been known. TB makes undernutrition 
worse and undernutrition weakens immunity, thereby increasing the likelihood that latent TB 
will develop into active disease. 
 
The common symptom with active TB in individuals is that they: 
 
 are in a catabolic (breakdown of protein/body tissue) state leading to muscle wasting,

 experience weight loss,

 have fever, fatigue, exhaustion and persistent coughing,

 show signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and

 have low body mass index (BMI) (lower than 18.5 kg/m2).
 
 
 
Why do you think weight loss occurs among those with TB? Weight loss can be caused 
by several factors, including: 
 
 
 reduced food intake due to loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal pain;

 loss of protein and other nutritional reserves due to fever ,

 malabsorption due to diarrhoea,

 loss of fluids, electrolytes

 metabolic alterations caused by the disease, and

 an increase in the energy expenditure of the patient in an attempt to fight infection
 
 
The progression of the disease may be slow gradual but can lead to serious consequences. The 
key to treatment, therefore, is early detection, followed by antibiotic therapy, adequate rest and 
diet management. Children with TB, in particular, need special attention since the child has 
increased requirements as a result of both growth and TB. Tuberculosis is completely curable 
through short-course chemotherapy. Treating TB cases who are sputum-smear positive (and who 
can therefore spread the disease to others) at the source, it is the most effective means of 
eliminating TB from a population.DOTS or Directly Observed Treatment Short course is the 
internationally recommended strategy for TB control that has been recognized as a highly 
efficient and cost-effective strategy. 
 
Let us study the dietary management next. 
 
Dietary Management of tuberculosis 
 
 
As undernutrition is highly prevalent among people with TB, the dietary recommendations 
for TB patients are based on the nutrient and energy requirements for hyper catabolic and 
undernourished patients. The main objective of diet therapy is to prevent weight loss, 
strengthen the immune system and accelerate recovery. An adequate diet containing all 
essential nutrients namely carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals and vitamins is necessary 
for the well being and health of the TB patient. 
 
 
Dietary considerations for tuberculosis 
 
Here are some recommendations on how to monitor weight gain in TB patients, 
particularly in children: 
 
 
 Encourage the individual to eat healthy, nourishing balanced diet.

 TB often adversely affects nutritional intake due to poor appetite, making patients at risk 
for malnutrition. Encourage patients to consume six smaller meals per day instead of 
three.

 Make the meals appetizing in appearance and taste and provide enough energy and 
protein.

 Commercially-available high energy and protein drinks (balanced in terms of micro- 
and macronutrients) may be used effectively to meet the increased requirements.

 Household ingredients such as sugar, vegetable oil, peanut butter, eggs and non-fat dry 
milk powder can be used in porridge, soups, gravies, milk based-drinks to increase the 
protein and energy content without adding to the bulk of the meal.

 At least 500ml to 1litre milk (or milk product like yoghurt t, soft cheese) should be 
consumed daily to ensure adequate intakes of vitamin D and calcium.
 
 
 Ensure consumption of at least five to six portions of fruit and vegetables per day. 
Pure fruit juice can be used to decrease the bulk of the diet.

 Provide adequate fluid intake (at least 10 to 12 glasses per day) to compensate 
for increased losses

 Provide a good multivitamin and mineral supplement.

 Ensure safe food handling and personal hygiene.
 
 
 
Now, can you now summarize the dietary recommendation for a TB patient. Prepare a list of 
foods you may include liberally or restrict/avoid in the diet of a TB patient.

CHAPTER 6: DIARRHOEA 
(TYPES, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) 
 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
 
1. Define diarrhoea and review the different terminologies used in the context 
of diarrhoea, 
 
2. Differentiate between different types of diarrhoea, 
 
3. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms and the metabolic changes during 
diarrhoea and 
 
4. Describe the diet therapy during diarrhoea. 
 
 
We have looked at the basic concepts and inter-relationship between fever, infection and 
nutrition in our study so far. Diarrhoea, an infection, is an important public health problem 
among under-five children in developing countries. Recent evidence suggests that diarrhoea is 
the third leading cause of childhood mortality in India, and is responsible for 13% of all 
deaths/year in children under five years of age. This chapter will focus on the 
classification/terminologies, determinants, preventive and control strategies of diarrhoea and 
dietary principles for management of diarrhoea at home or in a community setting. 
 
DIARRHOEA: DEFINITION, CAUSES & SYMPTOMS 
 
As per the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhoea is defined as the passage of three or 
more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than normal for the individual). 
Now consider the following cases. 
 
Case 1: Rani is a 2-year-old girl. She has a history of frequent passing of stools but they are well 
formed. As a baby who was breast fed, even then, Rani use to pass loose “pasty” (semi formed) 
stools. Her mother is worried. 
 
Case 2: Ramu is a 2-year-old boy. He has a 2-day history of watery diarrhoea. His mother 
informs that he has had several episodes of loose motions with 4-5 loose liquid stools passed per 
day. 
 
In your opinion are the two children suffering from Diarrhoea? Before you jump to any 
conclusion, please read the definition of diarrhoea once again more carefully. Then comment on 
each case. 
 
 
Diarrhoea is the passage of three or more liquid or watery stools in a day. Here the consistency 
and character of stools rather than the number of stools alone is critical. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6.1: Types of diarrhoea 
 
 
Now, considering the two cases mentioned above, Ramu is more likely to be suffering from 
diarrhoea as his stools are liquid, watery and off course frequent. Rani, though was passing 
frequent stools but the stools were well formed. Hence, she is not likely to be suffering from 
diarrhoea. Remember, Diarrhoea is characterized by the frequent passage of liquid stools, which 
is accompanied by excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium. 
Diarrhoea, is a symptom and not a disease. This must be clear to you. 
 
 
SYMPTOMS OF DIARRHOEA 
 
Diarrhoea is associated with symptoms depending on the cause and who is affected. 
 
Common symptom, however, include: 
 
 Watery, thin or loose stools

 Abdominal cramps

 Sense of urgency to have a bowel movement

 Nausea and vomiting
 
In addition to the symptoms described above, the symptoms of severe persistent diarrhea include: 
 
 Dehydration

 Blood, mucus, or undigested food in the stool

 Weight loss

 Fever
 
Diarrhoea can be life-threatening! During diarrhoea, the stools have high water content – an 
indicator that water is being lost in higher than normal amounts. The stools also contain a high 
amount of electrolytes (sodium, potassium). This results in the deficiency of water and 
electrolytes in the body which is referred to as dehydration. 
 
 
By now, you must have understood the consequences of diarrhea/dehydration and can appreciate 
that it is the highest cause of illness and death especially in children. So an understanding on 
what causes diarrhoea needs urgent attention. 
 
Causes of diarrhea 
 
 Diarrhoea, is usually a symptom of bowel infection. The infection may be caused by a 
wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and protozoa. These include:

 Bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), Vibrio cholerae 
(causing cholera) (Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella and Shigella: they all may cause 
food poisoning

 Virus, such as a Norovirus or Rotavirus
 Parasites, such as the Giardia intestinalis, that causes Giardiasis
 
Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water or from person to person as a 
result of poor hygiene. Poverty, ignorance, poor sanitation is often the underlying risk factors 
Diarrhoea caused by contaminated food or water while travelling is often known as traveller’s 
diarrhoea. 
 
Recognizing the ill-effects, management of diarrhoea, particularly in the context of management 
of dehydration and malnutrition is crucial which is discussed next. 
 
TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHOEA 
 
Diarrhea/dehydration should not be neglected and must receive prompt medical care to minimize 
the frequency of morbidity and mortalities. In light of the complications discussed above let us 
now examine what should be the objectives in the management of diarrhoea and more 
specifically dehydration. 
 
The major objectives in the management of diarrhoea include: 
 
1. Fluid and electrolyte replacement 
 
2. Removal of cause (especially if infection) 
 
3. Nutrition concerns 
 
4. Determining the status of dehydration 
 
5. Fluid management(ORT-Oral rehydration therapy) 
 
6. Nutritional management 
 
 
The first step in diarrhea management is to determine the status of dehydration. Let us 
consider this

A review on the use of ORT and the fluid therapy in the management of dehydration is presented next. The 
key to diarrhoea management is the early replacement of fluid lost in the stools through intravenous or oral 
route (by mouth). Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is at the core of management of diarrhoea. A review on 
the use of ORT and the fluid therapy in the management of dehydration is presented in this section. 
 
First let us understand what is ORT? Oral rehydration therapy is a simple treatment for dehydration 
associated with diarrhoea. The term ORT includes: 
 
 Complete oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution,

 Solutions made from sugar and salt,
 Food based solutions, and
 Home fluids without insisting on specified amounts of glucose and salt.
 
. The term ORS refers to the complete oral rehydration salt mixture. ORS is potentially the most 
important medical advance of this century. It is safe, effective and cost saving. ORS can alone successfully 
rehydrate 95-97% individuals with diarrhoea. A single universal ORS solution containing: sodium - 75 
mmol/l and glucose - 75 mmol/l, osmolarity 245 mosmol/l is recommended for all ages and all types of 
diarrhoea. 
 
How much of ORS to give for replacement of ongoing stool losses to maintain hydration. Refer to Table 
6.2 for easy reference.

CHAPTER 7-EATING DISORDERS 
 
(DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS,CLINICALSYMPTOMSAND 
DIETARY MANAGEMENT) 
 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
 
1. Define the term eating disorder, 
 
2. Define and differentiate between different types of eating disorders, 
 
3. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, metabolic changes and consequences of 
eating disorders, and 
 
4. Discuss the management of eating disorders with special reference to 
nutritional management. 
 
Disordered eating behavior includes a wide range of eating related problems such as inadequate eating 
pattern, including binge eating, purging and restrictive diet to lose or control weight, unhealthy dieting 
practices, maladaptive behavior related to dissatisfaction with body shape or size. Adolescents, young 
adulthood is a period of increased awareness of one’s body appearance and having a distorted body image 
or negative perception about one’s body weight and shape during this phase of life can be a potent cause of 
several unhealthy body- related behaviors and disordered eating patterns. In this chapter we will focus on 
these issues. We will learn about eating disorders - the types, causes, consequences and what dietary 
measures to adopt to manage the disordered eating condition. 
 
WHAT ARE EATING DISORDERS? 
 
Eating disorders are illnesses in which the people experience severe disturbances in their eating 
pattern/behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. People with eating disorders typically become pre-
occupied with food and their body weight. These disorders can affect a person's physical and mental health. 
Eating disorders are serious and sometimes fatal and life- threatening. 
 
Disorders include binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and, less common but very serious, anorexia 
nervosa. These conditions are defined herewith. 
 
Binge eating disorder 
 
Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent binge (excessive indulgence in eating) episode during 
which a person feels a loss of control and marked distress over his or her eating. Three particular features 
are characteristic of binge eating. These include: i) the amount of food eaten is larger than most persons 
would eat under similar circumstances, ii) the excessive eating occurs in a discreet period, usually less than 
2 hours, and iii) the eating is accompanied by a subjective sense of loss of control. 
 
 
 
Bulimia Nervosa 
 
Bulimia nervosa is an disorder characterized by binge eating (eating large amount of food in a short time, 
along with the sense of loss of control) followed by a type of behavior that compensates for the binge, such 
as purging (including self-induced vomiting), excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting and/or 
engaging in excessive exercise. 
 
People with bulimia can fall within normal range for their weight. But, they often fear gaining weight, want 
desperately to lose weight, and are intensely unhappy with their body size and shape. 
 
 
 
Anorexia Nervosa 
 
Anorexia refers to loss of appetite. Anorexia nervosa, therefore, is a disease characterized by a significant 
and persistent reduction in food intake leading to extremely low body weight in the context of age, sex, and 
physical health. Features characteristic of anorexia nervosa include: i) a relentless pursuit of thinness, ii) a 
distortion of body image and intense fear of gaining weight, and iii) extremely disturbed eating behavior. 
 
 
 
CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS, SIGN, SYMPTOMS OF EATING DISORDERS 
 
Having looked at the different types of eating disorders surely you may be able to distinguish between 
these specific conditions. To help you recall, you studied that: 
 
 Unlike bulimia nervosa, in binge eating disorder, binge eating episodes are not followed by 
purging, fasting or excessive exercise. People with binge eating disorder are often overweight or 
obese,

 Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their weight.

 People with anorexia see themselves as overweight, even when they are starved or severely
 
malnourished. 
 
Some common clinical characteristics and sign, symptoms associated with these disorders are highlighted 
in Table 7.1. Surely they will help you in diagnosis or further identification of an eating disorder. 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 7.1: Clinical features, signs and symptoms of eating disorders 
 
 
 
 
People with eating disorders may struggle with one or more of the following psychological problems: 
 
distress, anxiety, feeling of helplessness, low self esteem, inability to concentrate, unable to engage in 
 
conversation and withdrawn. The reality behind these conditions is that the brain is literally unable to 
 
function  properly  due  to  the  lack  of  nutrition  available  to  the  body.  Thus  knowledge 
of these 
 
signs/symptoms is critical. Understanding the signs, symptoms will help in identifying target

symptoms  and  behaviors  that  will  be  addressed  in  the  treatment  plan.  We  will  learn  about  the 
 
management of eating disorders later in this chapter. Next let us look at the causative factors. 
 
 
WHAT CAUSES EATING DISORDERS 
 
The exact cause of eating disorders is not known. But, it is thought to be multi-factorial in origin. The 
multidimensional causative factors may include: vulnerable personality; psychological conflicts – 
individual and family relationship; socio-cultural environmental factors - cult of thinness, hazardous 
dieting, social class and race and finally genetic and constitutional factors. 
 
The best-known environmental contributor to the development of eating disorders is the socio-cultural 
idealization of thinness. Young children start to express concern about their own weight or shape or about 
becoming too fat. Beauty and appearance anxiety are critical global issues and media and advertizing are 
key factor driving this concern. Pictures, television, magazines influence children’s/adolescents concept of 
the ideal body shape, influencing them to want to lose weight and promoting unrealistic standard of beauty. 
This concern endures through life. 
 
Bullying, weight stigma has been identified as yet another factor. Overweight girls and boys are teased 
about their weight by peers or family members. Individuals report coping with weight stigma by eating 
more food. Weight teasing or weight-based victimization among youth thus predicts weight gain, frequent 
binge eating, are at increased risk for eating disorder symptoms, and are more likely to have a diagnosis of 
binge eating disorder. Weight stigma is also a significant risk factor for depression, low self esteem and 
body dissatisfaction among individuals. 
 
 
Occupation/profession may also play a role. Athletes are at-risk, especially those competing in sports that 
tend to emphasize diet, appearance, size and weight, such as weight-class sports (wrestling, rowing, 
horseracing etc.) and aesthetic sports (bodybuilding, gymnastics, swimming etc.). Though most athletes 
with eating disorders are females, but male athletes also are at-risk. Similarly dancers have a prevalence of 
anorexia 10 times that of general population 
 
 
 
MANAGEMENT OF EATING DISORDERS 
 
The management of eating disorders should be a multidisciplinary approach. A multidisciplinary team 
comprising of a physician, nutritionist and psycho-therapists is usually involved in their management. The 
treatment of eating disorders can be said to have three components. 
 
A) Medical and Biochemical Management 
 
B) Nutritional Management, and 
 
C) Psychological Management 
 
Our focus in this unit will be only on nutritional management as psychological and medical 
management are not within our preview. 
 
Nutritional Management of Eating Disorders 
 
 
Here in this section we will consider the components of the management of anorexia nervosa and bulimia 
nervosa together, since the nutritional consequences and nutritional management for both these conditions 
are on similar lines. Malnutrition due to low or poor consumption of energy-giving macronutrients, such as 
carbohydrates, fats, proteins and/or micronutrients relative to individual needs is a concern with both 
anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. In both the cases, consideration needs to be given to symptoms of 
the starvation syndrome. Starvation syndrome here refers to starvation caused either by food 
restriction/dieting as in anorexia nervosa or problems related to food absorption as in purging or excessive 
exercise may mean that insufficient energy is consumed for weight maintenance in bulimia nervosa.

CHAPTER: 8 OVER WEIGHT/ OBESITY 
 
(DEFINITION, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) 
 
 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
 
1. Define the term overweight and obesity 
 
2. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, metabolic changes and consequences of 
obesity, 
 
3. Discuss the general strategies for obesity prevention, and 
4. Describe the dietary management of obesity. 
 
 
 
 
 
World Health Organization (WHO) defines Overweight and Obesity as a condition of abnormal or 
excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. 
 
So any individual with more than 120% of ideal body weight may be considered as overweight. The ideal 
body weight (IBW) can be calculated by the formula: 
 
IBW = (height in cm -100) × 0.9 
 
A simple measure, however, commonly used to classify overweight and obesity across all ages is BMI 
(Body Mass Index). BMI is defined as person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height 
in meters (kg/m2). 
 
[BMI = Weight (kg)/Height (m) 2] 
 
Overweight, Obesity among Adults 
 
BMI is considered to be the most useful population-level measure of obesity, as it is the same for both 
sexes and all ages of adults. The BMI based classification for adults (both International and for Asian 
population) is given in Table 8.1. As you may have noticed that WHO defines overweight and obesity as 
follows: 
 
• 
overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and 
• 
obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30. 
 
 
But, for Indian population, BMI between 18.5 and 23 is considered normal, since they tend to have higher 
percentage body fat even at lower BMI as compared to the European population. BMI greater than or equal 
to 23 is considered overweight/obese for Indian adult as indicated in Table .1. 
 
Table 8.1: BMI categories for adults (WHO)

23.0-24.9 kg/ m2 
Overweight

>25 kg/ m2 
Obese 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note, the BMI classification presented in Table 8.1 is specific to adult population only. You can use this 
classification to categorize adults into different grades of malnutrition. First calculate the BMI (based on 
weight and height) and then check in which class the individual's BMI falls. To illustrate, an Indian female 
(30 years of age) who weighs 70kg and height is 1.6 meters, BMI calculated is: 70/1.6 ×1.6 = 27.34kg/m2. 
As per BMI classification (Asian population in Table 8.1), the individual is obese. 
 
BMI cut-off levels for categorizing overweight and obesity among children and adolescent are different. 
The BMI classification presented in Table 8.1 is not applicable to children and adolescent. WHO has given 
the ideal ranges of weight for a given height for children 5-19 years of age. These Tables are useful for 
categorizing children as normal, under-nourished and overweight or obese. 
 
Obesity is defined based on the degree of excess fat. More than a general accumulation, the distribution of 
fat around the abdomen is now considered more harmful than fat around the hips. Accumulation of fat 
around the abdomen indicated by higher waist circumference is classified as central obesity. Waist 
circumference of 90cm for men and 80 cm for women classified as central obesity is associated with 
increased risk of several chronic diseases.

Measurements 
Descriptions 
 
 
Skinfold thickness 
Skin fold thickness is being  used for estimating the body fat content. This 
(SFT) 
requires special instruments called 'calipers'. Skin folds at different parts of the 
 
body (triceps, biceps, sub-scapular, supra-iliac, front thigh and calf) have been 
 
used for estimating body fat. Specific equations are used to convert the skin 
 
fold thickness into the body fat content. 
 
Advantage: Relatively simpler, non invasive and apart from the total body fat 
 
content, it can also indicate about the body fat distribution. 
 
 
Waist circumference WC is highly sensitive and specific measure of central obesity. Cut off values 
(WC) 
for adults available as highlighted earlier. 
 
Advantage: Simple technique 
 
Disadvantage: For children no Indian data available and not widely used.

(WHR) 
WHR cut offs available for adult males and females but not for children. WHR 
 
of more than 0.9 among men and 0.85 in women are associated with increased 
 
risk of several chronic diseases. 
 
 
 
 
 
WHY SHOULD WE AVOID OBESITY? 
 
Maintaining an ideal body weight is crucial for good health. There is no clear definition of ideal body 
weight, but body weight for a given height of a person with good health and long lifespan is considered as 
ideal body weight. Excessive body weight increases the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, 
hypertension, diabetes, certain types of cancers, osteoarthritis etc. Excess body fat broadly affects every 
organ in the body with multi-organ consequences. Major health consequences have been illustrated in 
Figure 8.2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.2: Major health consequences of overweight and obesity 
 
Obese children are not only at risk to become obese adults, and consequently suffer from ill health and 
premature death, but serious complications can also emerge during their childhood. Children with obesity 
have more risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol than their normal 
weight peers. Children with obesity are also at higher risk for having other chronic health conditions and 
diseases, such as asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly being 
reported among children who are overweight. Onset of diabetes in children can lead to heart disease and 
kidney failure. 
 
Overweight and obese adolescents may also suffer from: 
 
- 
depression, low self-esteem, and behavioral problems, 
- 
stigmatization (teasing, harassment, and rejection) and bullying behavior by their peers, 
 
- 
psychological distress manifested by poor self-image, aggressive and negative behavior, depression, 
suicide, and 
 
- 
drug abuse, alcohol and tobacco addiction. 
 
 
In view of the rising obesity prevalence, many of the young children and adolescents have developed ‘fear 
of fatness’ and are adopting various dietary and behavioral practices to lose weight and remain thin, even if 
they have normal BMI. It is more seen in urban areas at this moment. These individuals are at higher risk 
of developing eating disorders. 
 
Apart from health consequences which we discussed above, body fatness has other implications also. 
These are economic and academic burden. It has been estimated that obesity accounts for 2% to 7% of total 
healthcare costs in developed countries. There are also other costs to consider such as reduced quality of 
life and productivity loss attributed to decreased work efficiency and medical issues. With regards to 
academic consequences, among obese adolescents, higher school absenteeism, dropout and lower academic 
achievement have been seen. But, drawing definite conclusion on this issue is difficult. 
 
Considering the ill effects of obesity it is important that we look at the causes of obesity. The next section 
focuses on etiology of obesity. 
 
WHAT CAUSES OBESITY? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.3: The causes and risk factors of obesity 
 
Overweight and obesity, are broadly the result of an imbalance between energy intake (food) and energy 
expenditure (physical activity and some other metabolic activity). The imbalance might be due to excess 
energy intake (overeating) or reduced energy expenditure (sedentary lifestyle). The excess of energy 
consumed is stored in the body in the form of adipose tissue. When food availability is less, it could be seen 
as a survival mechanism, but when food is abundant and the physical activity level decreases, this results in 
fat deposition. Table 8.3 lists the key factors that might promote weight gain and obesity.

High intake of energy-dense, micronutrient poor foods

the Prevention of Chronic Diseases. World Health Organization; Geneva, Switzerland: 2003 
 
As highlighted in Table 8.3, increased risk factors include a higher energy density diet with increased 
intake of fat and added sugars, salt in foods. Eating junk or unhealthy foods coupled with low physical 
activity (sedentary lifestyle) promotes weight gain. Saturated fat intake (mostly from animal sources), 
marked increases in animal food consumption, reduced intakes of complex carbohydrates and dietary fiber, 
and reduced fruit and vegetable intake are other contributing factors. Over-feeding during infancy, 
childhood and adolescence predisposes to overweight/obesity in adulthood. 
 
Further, lack of access to healthy foods as determined by adverse socioeconomic conditions influences the 
diet and health of a population. Energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods provide daily calories at an 
affordable cost to the poor groups hence consumed in large portions. On the other hand, the commercial 
driven food market environment is other probable causes of obesity. The traditional micronutrient-rich 
foods consumed by children/families are replaced by heavily marketed, sugars-sweetened beverages (i.e. 
soft drinks) and energy dense fatty, salty and sugar foods (HFSS snacks), contributing to obesity. 
 
The dietary changes highlighted above are compounded by lifestyle changes that reflect reduced physical 
activity at work/school and during leisure time. Evidence suggests that insufficient physical activity is one 
of the important risk factors of obesity, and work-related activity has declined over recent decades, 
whereas, leisure time dominated by television viewing and other physically inactive pastimes has 
increased, particularly among children. 
 
Considering the multifaceted causes of obesity it is important that appropriate strategies based on improved 
dietary practices and physical activity for prevention of obesity are considered. The next section focuses on 
prevention strategies followed by dietary management of obesity. 
 
 
GENERAL STRATEGIES FOR OBESITY PREVENTION 
 
 
The prevention of obesity in infants, young children, adolescents and adults should be considered of 
 
high priority. There can be no single or simple solution to the increasing prevalence of obesity. It’s a 
 
complex problem and there has to be a multifaceted approach. Policy makers, state and local 
governments/organizations, business and community leaders, school, childcare and healthcare 
professionals, parents and individuals must work together to create an environment that supports a 
healthy lifestyle. 
 
 
For infants and young children, the main preventive strategies should focus on: 
 
• 
the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding; 
• 
avoiding the use of added sugars and starches when feeding formula; 
 
• 
instructing mothers to accept their child’s ability to regulate energy intake rather than feeding 
until the plate is empty; 
 
• 
assuring the appropriate micronutrient intake for the child needed to promote optimal growth 
and development. 
 
 
For school children and adolescents, prevention of obesity implies the need to: 
 
• 
promote an active lifestyle; 
• 
limit television viewing; 
• 
promote the intake of fruits and vegetables (at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily) 
 
• 
restrict the intake of unhealthy, energy-dense, micronutrient-poor foods (e.g. packaged 
snacks ( rich in fat, sugar and salt), refined grains and sweets, potatoes etc); 
 
• 
restrict the intake of sugars-sweetened soft drinks, sport drinks and fruit juice drinks. 
 
• 
improving sleep, 
• 
reducing stress 
 
 
The home environment too is another important setting in preventing overweight and obesity. Parents 
can play a crucial role. Potential areas to target in terms of television viewing, home food and physical 
activity environment include: 
 
• 
Purchasing healthy foods, 
• 
Practicing regular meal times, 
• 
Encouraging the children to eat only when hungry and to eat slowly. 
• 
Allocating individual portions of food for children, 
 
• 
Keep the refrigerator stocked with fat-free or low-fat milk and fresh fruit and vegetables instead of 
soft drinks and snacks high in sugar and fat. 
 
• 
Creating opportunities for physical activities, 
 
• 
Parents as role model. Parents who eat healthy foods and are physically active set an example 
that increases the likelihood their children will do the same, 
 
• 
Messages to parents to not having television in children’s room and encouraging family rules 
restricting television viewing. 
 
 
Children should be encouraged to participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate intensity physical 
activity, preferably daily in the form of sports and physical activity. Some examples of moderate 
intensity physical activity may include: brisk walking, skipping (rope jumping), playing soccer, 
swimming, dancing etc. 
 
In addition to encouraging physical activity, children should avoid too much sedentary time. Parents 
should limit the time children watch television, play video games, or surf the web to no more than 2 
hours per day. Additionally, television viewing for children age 2 or younger may be best avoided. 
Instead, encourage children to find fun activities to do with family members or on their own that simply 
involve with more activity. 
 
 
Preventive measures for adults: 
 
The preventive measures highlighted above may apply to preventing obesity among adults too. Some 
healthy eating practices and points to consider that may protect against weight gain may include: 
 
• 
eating five to six servings of vegetables and fruits daily, 
 
• 
choosing whole grain foods and avoiding highly processed foods made with refined flour, sugar and 
saturated fat in the diet, 
 
• 
avoiding foods which are high in ‘energy density’ or that have lots of calories in a small amount of 
food, 
 
• 
decreasing sugar-sweetened beverages 
 
 
Preventive strategies for adults may also include promotion of small changes in physical activity. A total 
of 60 min of physical activity is recommended every day for healthy Asian Indians. This should include 
at least 30 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g. brisk 
 
walking, jogging, hiking, bicycling, gardening etc), 15 min of work-related activity e.g. carrying heavy 
loads, climbing stairs etc.), and 15 min of muscle-strengthening exercises (at least 3-4 times a week). 
Note inactive people should start slow and gradually increase physical activity. 
 
The food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by: 
 
• 
reducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods; 
• 
ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers; 
 
• 
restricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at 
children and teenagers; and 
 
• 
ensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activity 
practice in the workplace. 
 
 
So prevention is always better than cure. Maintaining a desirable body weight by consuming just enough 
calories or adjust physical activity to maintain energy balance (i.e. intake = output) is critical to prevent and 
treat obesity. The next focus in this unit is how to maintain energy balance and reduce weight. 
 
DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 
 
 
 
A combination of interventions/strategies may be adopted to manage obesity. These include: 
 
a. dietary modification, 
b. increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary lifestyle, and 
c. behavior modification 
 
 
Successful treatment, management of overweight, obesity requires adoption and maintenance of lifestyle 
behaviors contributing to both dietary intake and physical activity. Role of physical activity in reducing 
prevalence of obesity has already been highlighted in the section on prevention Here we shall focus on 
dietary management of obesity. 
 
The objective of diet planning for overweight/obese individual must focus on: 
 
• 
promoting gradual weight reduction 
• 
preventing muscle loss and other nutritional deficiencies 
• 
helping to maintaining a desirable body weight, and 
• 
bring positive behavioral changes (diet/ life style management) 
 
To meet these objectives the nutrient needs and dietary modifications for overweight, obesity are 
highlighted in Table 8.4.

Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
1. Define the term hypertension, 
 
2. Enumerate the risk factors in causation of hypertension, 
 
3. Discuss the complications and consequences of hypertension, and 
 
4. Describe the dietary management and prevention of hypertension with 
special emphasis on lifestyle modification. 
 
 
Hypertension is fast becoming a common health problem in India, likely because people are adopting 
increasingly sedentary lifestyles and poor eating habits. It is important to note that men/women, young/old 
adults all are at risk of this problem and it is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, heart failure, renal 
disease and other complications. What is alarming is the fact that hypertension is known as a silent killer. It 
often occurs without any symptom or warning signs until more serious problem arises. Modifying lifestyle 
factors is important for managing hypertension. 
 
Hypertension is a health condition characterized by high blood pressure. Blood pressure (BP) is the force of 
circulating blood against the inner walls of blood vessels. When blood travels through the blood vessels with 
more force than is considered healthy it is called hypertension. An instrument/devise called 
sphygmomanometer is used to measure BP. 
 
An optimum blood pressure level is a reading under 120/80mm Hg. The numerator 120 represents the pressure 
when the heart contracts and is referred to as “Systolic pressure”. The systolic measurement is the peak 
pressure in the arteries. The denominator 80 represents the pressure when the heart relaxes (is at rest) between 
beats, called the “Diastolic pressure”. Diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure in the arteries. Recent 
guidelines have given the classification of blood pressure and the stages of hypertension (in adults) based on 
blood pressure values as highlighted in Table 9.1

SYMPTOMS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
 
I. 
Consequences of hypertension: 
 
(a) Damage to arteries and blood vessels: Hypertension 
gradually increases the pressure flowing through the 
arteries leading to damaged or narrowed arteries. Once 
the arteries are damaged, the fat from the diet enters the 
blood stream and tends to get collect in the inner walls 
of arteries, over a period of time it leads 
 
to the 
narrowing of the lumen of the arteries, as a 
 
Figure 9.1 Blood Vessel 
result 
artery walls becoming less elastic, limiting 
 
 
blood  flow  through  the  body.  The  diseases of  the 
arteries resulting from the blockage of arteries are 
generally called coronary artery disease (CAD). 
 
(b) Damage to heart: The major function of the heart is to pump blood to the entire body. Uncontrolled blood 
pressure can damage the heart in several ways. It affects the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscles. 
When blood cannot flow freely to the heart, the individual can experience chest pain (angina), a heart 
attack or irregular heartbeat or irregular rhythm (arrhythmias). Over time, the strain on the heart caused by 
high BP can cause the heart muscle to weaken and work less efficiently. High blood pressure then forces 
the heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to rest of the body. This causes the 
ventricle to thicken and stiffen, limiting the ventricle ability to pump blood thus increasing the risk of heart 
attack, heart failure or sudden death. Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath or troubled 
breathing, swelling in the feet, ankles, legs or abdomen, fatigue. 
 
(c) Damage to Brain: Like the heart, the brain too requires constant supply of blood. Blood carries nourishing 
food to the brain so that it can work properly. Sometimes there can be a temporary disruption of blood 
supply to the brain caused by artery blockage or a blood clot both of which can arise from high blood 
pressure. Interruption of blood flow to the brain can lead to mild cognitive impairment or to dementia, a 
brain disease resulting in problems with thinking, speaking, reasoning, memory, vision and movement. 
Uncontrolled high BP can damage and weaken brain’s blood vessels causing them to narrow, rupture or 
leak leading to forming blood clots in the arteries (leading to the brain) blocking blood flow causing stroke. 
Stroke is a condition when part of the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, causing brain cells to die. 
 
 
(d) Damage to Kidneys: Major function of the kidneys is to filter extra fluids and waste from the blood - a 
process that depends on healthy blood vessels. Like the blood vessels in the brain and the heart, high BP 
can damage large arteries leading to kidney and the tiny blood vessels within the kidney. As a result 
kidneys are unable to filter extra fluid, waste; thus dangerous levels of these accumulate leading to kidney 
failure. 
 
(e) Damage to Eyes: Like other blood vessels these too can be damaged due to high BP. Blood vessels 
supplying blood to the retina (membrane that lines the inner surface of the back of the eyeball) when 
damaged can lead to bleeding in the eyes, blurred vision and complete loss of vision. 
 
 
(f) Sleep Disorder: Some people experience loud snoring and breathing interruptions during a night’s sleep. 
This condition is called sleep apnea. People with sleep apnea often don’t feel rested when they wake up in 
the morning. Research has linked this condition to high blood pressure. 
 
 
II. 
Causes of Hypertension 
 
 
 
The factors that play a role in causing or increasing the risk of getting a disease are called risk factors. Table 
9.2 highlights the risk factors for hypertension. Smoking, diabetes, elevated lipid levels (high cholesterol, 
triglyceride), excessive weight, low fitness, unhealthy diet, psychosocial stress, sleep disturbances are some of 
the risk factors. In Table 9.2 you will notice that these factors are categorized as modifiable and non-
modifiable. 
 
Table 9.2: Risk Factors Common in Patients with Hypertension 
 
 
Modifiable Risk Factors 
Relatively Fixed/Non-modifiable Risk Factors 
 
 
 
 
- Cigarette smoking, secondhand smoking 
- CAD 
- Diabetes mellitus 
- Family history 
- Dyslipidemia/hypercholesterolemia 
- Increased age 
- Overweight/obesity 
- Low socioeconomic/educational status 
- Physical inactivity/low fitness 
- Obstructive sleep apnea 
- Unhealthy diet 
- Psychosocial stress 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dietary factors are an important determinant of development and progression of hypertension. It is one of the 
important modifiable risk factors for hypertension. Unhealthy diets consisting of high fat, salt, sugar (HFSS) 
foods are the main culprit. Most commonly consumed HFSS foods include chips, fried foods, sugar sweetened 
carbonated and non- carbonated beverages, pizzas, burgers, ready-to-eat noodles, potato fries, and 
confectionery items. There is a strong association between salt intake and blood pressure. Excessive salt intake 
has been associated with increased prevalence of hypertension and a rise in systolic pressure with age. 
Excessive sodium intake can cause body to retain fluid and also cause arteries/blood vessels to constrict, which 
increases blood pressure. Also a diet high in calories, saturated fats like ghee, butter and food rich in animal 
fats (such as whole milk, red meat, organ meats), trans fats (deep fried snacks/foods, bakery products etc.) and 
processed, packaged foods such as chips, cookies etc. Carries an additional risk of hypertension. Packaged and 
processed foods often have sodium added during manufacturing either as salt or as baking soda. 
 
 
Hypertension is often present in individuals who are overweight and obese In fact, hypertension is strongly 
associated with high body mass index (BMI). More the weight, more the blood flow required to supply oxygen 
and nutrients to the tissues. As the volume of the blood increases so does the pressure inside the arteries. 
Hence people who are obese are likely to have higher blood pressure. 
 
Physical inactivity or low fitness also increases the risk of obesity along with hypertension. Regular exercise 
increases blood flow through arteries and release substances that relax blood vessels, which in turn lower 
blood pressure. Remember, sedentary lifestyle devoid of exercise increases the risk of blood pressure. Along 
with sedentary lifestyle, smoking, tobacco intake is other modifiable risk factors. What must be emphasized 
here is that these factors also make elevated blood pressure difficult to control despite progressively increasing 
doses of medication. Hence lifestyle/dietary management is important for such patients in order to avoid drug 
dependency. 
 
 
MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION & DIETETICS 
 
Dietary/nutritional management is the cornerstone of hypertension management. We will focus on this aspect 
in more details here. 
 
I. 
Nutritional Management of Hypertension 
 
The main objective of dietary management of hypertension is to: 
 
 Achieve gradual weight loss in overweight and obese individuals and maintain weight slightly below 
the normal level,

 Reduce sodium intake and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance,
 Maintain adequate nutrition, and
 Slow down the onset of complications

You may have noticed that the meals of a person with high blood pressure need not be very different from 
meals provided to a normal person, but success lies in lowering salt intake and eating whole foods that are high 
in nutrients. As per the salt restriction prescribed, mild Sodium restriction: 2-3 g or Moderate sodium 
restriction: 1g or Strict sodium restriction: 0.5 g diet may be planned by judicious selection of foods. 
 
 
Some handy lifestyle modifications and proven interventions for prevention and treatment of 
hypertension are summarized herewith for your reference. 
 
 
Table 9.5 Lifestyle Modifications and Interventions for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension 
 
Lifestyle 
Recommendation/Intervention 
Modifications 
 
Weight Loss 
-   Best goal is to maintain ideal body weight. BMI (Weight (kg)/Height 
 
 
(m) 2
 ) < 22.9 kg/ m2  (Asian population). Waist circumference should also be 
 
 
maintained at an appropriate level (< 90cm for men and < 80 cm for women). 
 
-   Aim for at least 1-kg reduction in body weight for most adults who are 
 
 
overweight.  1kg  reduction  in  body  weight  will  reduce  blood  pressure  by 
 
 
1mm/Hg 
Healthy Diet 
-   Adapt  the  DASH  (Dietary  Approaches  to  Stopping  Hypertension)  dietary 
 
 
pattern. The DASH diet consists mainly of fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy 
 
 
products and includes whole grains, poultry, fish and nuts while limiting the 
 
 
amount of red meat, sweets and sugar-containing beverages. 
 
-   Provide a rich-fiber diet such as: 
 
 
  Whole  grain  cereals (wheat,  maize,  Dalia,  oats  etc.)  and  cereal products 
 
 
(whole wheat bread, multigrain bread etc.). Do not sieve wheat flour. Add 
 
 
bran to wheat flour, if needed, 
 
 
  Whole pulses such as Chana, lobia, rajmah etc., include sprouted pulses in the 
 
 
diet as salads, or as a filling, 
 
 
  Plenty of vegetables in the diet, particularly fresh green vegetables as salads 
 
 
in both meals, 
 
 
  Whole fruits (4-5 servings), preferably with edible peel. 
 
-   Use healthy oils such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, mustard oil. 
 
-   Include low-fat dairy and dairy product 
 
-   Intake of fish and poultry to be encouraged 
Reduced intake of 
-   Select foods that are low in sodium. 
dietary sodium 
- 
Watch out for processed food, packaged foods and restaurant food, especially fast 
 
 
food, which tend to be high in salt. 
 
-   Lower the salt intake. The target of salt restriction is <3 g/day. 
 
-   No added Salt. Avoid use of table salt. Use lemon, vinegar, tamarind etc. for 
 
 
flavoring salads. 
Enhanced intake of 
- 
Enhance the intake of dietary potassium. Include foods rich in potassium like 
dietary potassium  
fruits, vegetables etc. 
Physical Activity

CHAPTER 10: DIABETES MELLITUS 
 
(DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, COMPLICATIONS AND DIETARY 
MANAGEMENT) 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this , the students will be able to: 
 
1. Define the term diabetes and present the classification of Diabetes, 
 
2. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, complications of Diabetes, and 
 
3. Describe the management of Diabetes, with a focus on diet therapy and 
dietary management. 
 
In your day to day life you may have heard family, friends, and acquaintances complaining of suffering from 
“Sugar Problem” or “Madhumeh”. Newspaper articles, TV commercials promising simple, home remedies for 
cure of sugar problem are on the rise. Today, the so-called sugar problem or “Diabetes” has become a major 
public health problem in our country In this chapter we will consider the risk factors, symptoms and 
complications of Diabetes with major focus on management of diabetes. Diet, exercise, drugs, communication 
and nutrition education/awareness as major components of dietary management will be highlighted. 
 
 
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a condition, when the blood glucose or so called “blood sugar” is too high. Diabetes 
is a disease that affects body’s ability to produce or respond to insulin. Insulin, is a hormone that is released in 
response to food we eat. In a normal healthy person, the pancreas release insulin to help the body store and use 
the sugar from the food they eat. Foods, particularly carbohydrate-rich foods in our diet namely, rice, wheat, 
potatoes etc. are digested and broken down into a sugar called glucose. Glucose is vital for our health because 
it is an important source of energy for our body. Insulin helps to utilize this glucose to produce energy by the 
body for our daily activities. Insulin also stimulates the cells to take up glucose, thus prevents a rise in blood 
glucose and maintains its level within certain normal limits. 
 
SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
 
In diabetic individuals, the pancreas (the organ that produces 
insulin) cannot produce enough insulin or whatever is 
produced is not efficiently used by the body and sugar builds 
up in the blood (hyperglycemia). This condition when insulin 
is not efficiently used by the body is called insulin resistance. 
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic syndrome characterized by 
hyperglycaemia with disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism 
resulting from defect in insulin secretion, insulin action or 
both. In Diabetes, there is excessive glucose in blood and 
urine due to inadequate production of insulin or insulin 
resistance. Generally, in normal persons, without diabetes 
fasting glucose levels are maintained at less than 110mg/dl. 
After a 
 
meal (post prandial), the plasma glucose level increases but Figure 10.1 Pancreas insulin 
stimulates the cells to take up glucose and thus the plasma glucose levels return to basal level 
within 2 hours. 
 
The criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes is given in Table 
10.1.

You would notice that fasting plasma glucose (FPG) more than or equal to 126mg/dl and plasma glucose 
level 2-hour post meal (or post 75g glucose) more than or equal to 200mg/dl is diagnosed as diabetes 
 
Generally, glucose is excreted in urine when blood glucose levels are high, beyond 180mg/dl. This condition is 
described as renal glycosuria. It may be noted that diabetics lose varying amount of glucose in urine 
depending on severity of diseases and dietary intake of carbohydrates in their diet. 
 
Another concept, important to diabetes status, which needs special mention here, is Glycosylated Hemoglobin 
(HBA1c). When the concentration of glucose in blood rises, more of it gets attached to hemoglobin (which is a 
pigment present in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the cells of the body) forming glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HBA1c). In a normal individual without diabetes, the HBA1c concentration varies from 5-6%, 
while in diabetics, it increases to over 6% of the total hemoglobin depending on the blood glucose level. So 
what is the significance of HBA1c? HBA1c shows the general trend of glucose levels in the blood during the 
previous 2-3 months. HBA1c helps determine how well a person’s diabetes is being controlled over time. 
 
 
I. 
Types of Diabetes 
 
There are two main types of diabetes: 
 
 
Type 1 Diabetes and
 
Type 2 Diabetes
 
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus 
 
 
Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas’s failure to produce insulin. This form was previously referred to as 
‘insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus’ (IDDM) or ‘juvenile diabetes’, Type 1 diabetes may affect people at any 
age, but usually develops in children and adolescents, hence was referred to as juvenile diabetes earlier. Type 1 
diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune refers to the fact that the body’s immune system (which 
normally helps in fighting infections) attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. As a 
result there is little or no production of insulin and hence, such individuals require daily dose of insulin 
injections to control the level of glucose in the blood. When insulin is not provided it can lead to life 
threatening consequences. 
 
 
 
 
 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
 
Type 2 diabetes is the common form of diabetes, with 90-95% of people with diabetes having this condition. 
Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance. This means no matter how much or how little insulin is made, 
the body cannot use it as well as it should, and sugar builds up in the blood. As the disease progresses 
eventually no insulin is produced. This form was previously referred to as ‘non-insulin dependent diabetes’ or 
‘adult onset diabetes’, because it was diagnosed mainly in adults, who did not require insulin to manage their 
condition. It is associated with excessive body weight and/or fat (obesity) or sedentary lifestyle. Type 2 
diabetes can occur at any age. Type 2 diabetes can be managed through exercise and diet but overtime people 
with this type of diabetes may require oral anti-diabetic drugs or/and insulin depending on the condition. 
 
 
 
Besides the two types of diabetes highlighted above, you may come across cases where diabetes developed 
during pregnancy. This is referred to as gestational diabetes. 
 
Gestational Diabetes 
 
When a pregnant woman develops diabetes, it is known as gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually 
disappears after pregnancy but is associated with complications to both mother and baby. The offspring are 
prone to develop childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life as an adult. Women with a history of 
gestational diabetes may also go on to develop type 2 diabetes immediately after delivery or few years after 
delivery. 
 
Considering the different types of Diabetes it is important that we look at the risk factors associated with 
diabetes. The next section focuses on the risk factors. 
 
Risk factors of Diabetes 
 
The causes of diabetes are multi-factorial and depending on the type of diabetes the risk factors contributing to 
the onset of the disease may vary. Actual cause is not clear, but factors that have been shown to increase the 
risk of diabetes are highlighted below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10.2 Risk factors of diabetes 
 
In case of type 1 diabetes, it is an auto-immune disease. What is known is that the immune system (which 
fights infections, harmful bacteria, viruses in our body) attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells in the 
pancreas. For example viral infections such as measles, mumps can trigger abnormal auto immune response 
that destroy the insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Thus little or no insulin is produced. Instead of being 
transported to the cells, sugar then builds up in the blood. Genetic and environmental factors play an important 
role in the onset of this condition. 
 
 
Type 2 diabetes, which you have learnt is the most common form of diabetes, is caused by many factors but 
the two important risk factors include lifestyle factors and genes. Among lifestyle factors, lack of physical 
activity, overweight, obesity increase the risk of developing diabetes in the later stage of a person’s life. You 
would notice that about 90% of type 2 diabetic individuals are overweight or obese. Central obesity 
(accumulation of fat around the abdomen indicated by higher waist circumference) is known to increase 
insulin resistance. How does obesity increase the risk of diabetes? Well obesity reduces the sensitivity of 
tissues to insulin action in the utilization of glucose. Next, unhealthy eating habits and practices (such as eating 
too much of fat, simple sugars, and refined foods and not consuming enough fiber in the diet) have been 
shown to influence the development of diabetes. Further, type 2 diabetes seems to run in families, indicating 
genetic predisposition or hereditary as risk factor. Among other factors, ageing i.e. increased age enhances the 
risk of type 2 diabetes. Stress which is so common in modern life is now increasingly being recognized as a 
risk factor for disease onset and progression. 
 
Having gone through the risk factors, you may have realized that many of these factors can be controlled by 
the choices we make. For instance, physically inactivity, obesity, unhealthy diets, stress can be controlled and 
are therefore called modifiable risk factors. Others such as hereditary, age, history of gestational diabetes we 
cannot change or modify, hence are fixed. Remember the risk for diabetes increases if an individual is: 
 
 
 
 Overweight and obese, particularly central obesity i.e. accumulation of fat around the abdomen 
indicated by higher waist circumference,

 On an unhealthy diet, consuming too much fat, simple sugars, refined foods and low intake of 
dietary fiber (inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption),

 Age 40 or older. Risk increases as you grow old

 Has a parent or sibling with diabetes
 Physically inactive i.e. living a sedentary life,
 Has high blood pressure, high cholesterol or high triglyceride
 Have had gestational diabetes
 
So more the risk factors you have the greater the chances of developing diabetes and other health issues. 
 
Complications of Diabetes 
 
 
The symptoms of diabetes are very typical, but sometimes they are so mild that we don't notice them. But in 
case of Type 1 diabetes, the symptoms usually happen quickly and are much more severe as compared to type 
2 diabetes. However, you would notice that both types of diabetes have some warning symptoms which 
include: 
 
 Frequent and increased/excessive urinary output (Polyuria)
 Feeling of thirst (Polydipsia) and dry mouth

 Hunger, increased appetite (Polyphagia) even though the individual is eating
 
 Extreme fatigue, lack of energy, easy tiredness and irritability

 Unexplained Weight loss
 Blurry vision
 Frequent infections such as skin, vaginal infections
 Cuts, bruises, sores which are slow to heal, and
 Tingling sensation, pain or numbness in the hands and feet
 
 
The symptoms may seem mild, but it is important to note that diabetes can increase the risk of many serious 
health problems, if not controlled. Diabetes can cause a host of complications - acute as well as long term - 
affecting nearly every organ in our body including heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, 
gums, teeth etc. But the good news is that controlling diabetes can help avoid these complications or prevent 
them from becoming worse. 
 
The acute complications of diabetes include: 
 
Diabetic ketoacidosis: Ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces 
high levels of blood acids called ketones. How are ketones formed? When there is not enough insulin, the body 
cannot utilize carbohydrates to provide energy. So, to meet the energy needs, the body begins to break down 
fat as a fuel. This results in increased formation of ketones. When the ketones produced are more than what the 
body can handle, they accumulate in the blood resulting in ketoacidosis. Note, ketoacidosis can be fatal, and 
the patient may go into coma. This condition usually results from irregular or inadequate management of 
diabetes, particularly during stress and acute infections. Among long-term complications, heart diseases and 
blood vessel diseases are common problem. Due to injury to large blood vessels, diabetics have increased 
predisposition to atherosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels due to deposition of fatty substances). Diabetics 
may have high levels of blood lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, which make them susceptible to 
heart diseases and stroke. Diabetes can also lead to eye problems such as glaucoma, which may cause 
blindness if not treated. So the bottom line for diabetics is to get tight control of the blood glucose levels and 
thus prevent the complications from getting worse. Besides the acute and the long-term complications 
highlighted above, one short-term complications of diabetes which requires mention here is hypoglycemia. 
 
 
 
Unlike increased glucose levels in the blood, the rapid and severe lowering of blood glucose below certain 
critical normal limit (below 40 - 50 mg/dl) in the body is known as hypoglycemia. The person with 
hypoglycemia experiences weakness, sweating, restlessness, palpitation and giddiness. What may be the cause 
of hypoglycemia? It is possible for the blood glucose levels to drop when there is inadequate amount of 
carbohydrates in the diet, particularly under conditions when an individual is on insulin or taking insulin on an 
empty stomach or while fasting. Hypoglycemia can also occur following a strenuous exercise. 
 
 
Cases of hypoglycemia can be treated by immediately providing orange juice or glucose, sugar or sweet, 
which can rapidly raise the blood glucose level. It is always advisable for a diabetic to carry any one of these 
substances as a protective measure. 
 
Remember maintenance of blood glucose within normal limits helps to prevent and limit progression of 
diabetic complications. A patient who maintains the blood glucose levels within the normal range suffer 
 
from much less short and long term complications as compared to those who frequently experience 
fluctuations (some time high, sometime low) in the blood glucose levels. 
 
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES & DIETETICS 
 
It is important to understand that diabetes cannot be completely cured or treated, but it can be managed 
carefully in order to prevent/delay the development of complications. Management of diabetes is quite 
individualized and focuses not only on the diabetic state but also on the overall health and well-being of the 
diabetic patient. There are four main aspects in the management of diabetes. These include: 
 
• 
Dietary Management 
• 
Lifestyle Management - Exercise 
• 
Adherence to Drugs/Medication, Insulin schedule, and Education, communication and awareness 
 
 
We begin our study of dietary management of diabetes by first looking at the main objectives in the 
management of diabetes. 
 
Dietary Management of Diabetes 
 
Diet plays a crucial role in the management of diabetes. The main objectives of dietary management 
of diabetes are to: 
 
• 
attain and maintain ideal/desirable body weight 
• 
achieve and maintain normal blood glucose levels and reduce the sugar in the urine 
• 
provide adequate nutrition to maintain optimal nutritional status 
• 
treat the symptoms, and 
• 
prevent/avoid the acute complications 
• 
achieve optimum blood lipid levels 
 
 
In general, the nutritional needs of a diabetic are not much different than the needs of a non- diabetic 
individual. For instance, in case of a normal healthy individual, the normal diet should provide 60-65% 
calories from carbohydrates, 20-25% calories from fats and rest (15- 20%) from proteins. A diabetic diet too 
can follow this distribution but is governed by the present body weight of the patient and the need to maintain 
the desirable or ideal body weight. Before you review these considerations, it is important for you to 
understand that carbohydrates and dietary fiber play a major role in the control of blood glucose. Glycemic 
index is a guide used to classify carbohydrate containing foods according to their potential to raise the blood 
sugar level. It is therefore useful in planning diets for diabetics. Read the concept of glycemic index presented 
in the next section first. 
 
Glycemic Index 
 
Glycemic index (GI) describes the rise of blood glucose occurring after a meal. In a given meal there can be 
different foods. It is, therefore, important to know about the extent of rise in blood glucose with a given 
quantity of a particular food. 
 
Different carbohydrates raise blood glucose to variable extent. GI, therefore, gives a ranking of how quickly 
each carbohydrate-base food or drink makes the blood glucose rise after consuming them, in comparison to the 
response to an equivalent amount of glucose. A rating of each food between Zero to 100 is provided. Glucose 
raises the blood sugar levels very quickly and has a GI of 100. In comparison multi-grain Roti has low GI of 
27 and is beneficial for diabetics. GI, therefore, is a useful guide in planning diets for diabetics. Generally, 
there is no standard way to categories food based on GI, but for convenience three categories of food based on 
their GI value can be considered: the high-GI index foods (value>70), intermediate-GI foods (>55 to <70) and 
low-GI foods (<55). For your reference glycemic index of some common foods used in Indian diets are 
presented in Table 10.2

Diabetes Education: Cornerstone of Diabetes Management 
 
Unlike other disease conditions (such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels) where medication 
alone can often time successfully treat it; here there are lots of other components to diabetes. Diabetics require 
day-to-day knowledge of nutrition, exercise, medication, glucose monitoring, psychosocial adjustment etc. 
Diabetes education therefore becomes important. Diabetes education means empowering people with diabetes 
with knowledge and provide tools crucial for making them active partners in the diabetes management team. 
People with diabetes need to be educated regarding: 
 
The nature of disease, the possibility of development of short term and long term complications, if the 
condition is not managed appropriately. 
 
 
Self-monitoring skills
 
Appropriate self-care skills
 
Appropriate resources


Physical Activity Guidelines for Indian Population 
 
The health benefits of physical activity are well established. Lifestyle intervention studies have shown that 
Type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) can be prevented with appropriate physical activity and 
diet. What is appropriate physical activity for the Indian population? The guidelines for adults and children are 
highlighted herewith: 
 
1. A total of 60 min of physical activity is recommended every day for healthy Asian Indians in view of the high 
predisposition to develop T2DM and CHD. This should include at least 30 min of moderate-intensity aerobic 
activity (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, hiking, gardening, bicycling etc.), 15 min of work-related activity (e.g., 
carrying heavy loads, climbing stairs etc.), and 15 min of muscle-strengthening exercises (such as playing on 
playground equipment, climbing trees, playing tug-of- war, lifting weights etc.). 
 
 
2. For children, moderate-intensity physical activity for 60 min daily should be in the form of sport and physical 
activity. 
 
Educate the diabetic patients to follow an appropriate physical activity schedule.

CHAPTER 11: HEPATITIS/ JAUNDICE 
 
(DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, COMPLICATIONS AND 
DIETARY MANAGEMENT) 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this chapter the students will be able to: 
 
1. Understand the role of Liver in the smooth functioning of the body. 
2. Enumerate the risk factors in causation of Jaundice and Hepatitis, 
3. Discuss the complications and consequences of Jaundice and Hepatitis. 
4. Describe the dietary management and prevention of Liver infected diseases. 
 
 
Liver is the largest organ of the body constituting 2.5 to 3% of the body weight. It is a 
multifunctional organ which plays an important role in carbohydrate, fat and protein 
metabolism. Most of the end products of digestion of food are transported directly to the 
liver. Compounds which it synthesizes, or stores are sent to other parts of the body when 
needed. Toxic substances which may enter via food or are produced in other parts of the body 
are detoxified here. Thus, liver has an important bearing on the nutritional status and diseases 
of this organ markedly affect health. 
 
The function of the liver has been summarised in the table given below: -

HEPATITIS 
 
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to 
fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of 
hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and 
autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
 
I. 
Causes: 
 
There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. 
 
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often 
transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can 
also spread HAV. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV. 
 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other 
body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or 
from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through 
transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during 
medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Safe and effective vaccines are available 
to prevent HBV. 
 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may 
happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated 
injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is 
also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV. 
 
 
Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual 
infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. 
Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection. 
 
 
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or 
food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is 
increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and 
effective vaccines to prevent HEV infection have been developed but are not widely 
available. 
 
Initial symptoms of hepatitis caused by infection are like the flu and include: 
 
 
Muscle and joint pain
 
A high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4F) or above
 
Feeling unwell
 
Headache

 
Occasionally yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), Symptoms of chronic hepatitis can 
include: Feeling tired all the time, Depression, Jaundice, A general sense of feeling unwell.

The period of time between exposure to hepatitis and the onset of the illness is called the 
incubation period. The incubation period varies depending on the specific hepatitis virus. 
Hepatitis A virus has an incubation period of about 15 to 45 days; Hepatitis B virus from 45 
to 160 days, and Hepatitis C virus from about 2 weeks to 6 months. Many patients infected 
with HAV, HBV, and HCV have few or no symptoms of illness. 
 
The most common symptoms of different types of hepatitis includes: 
 
 
Dark urine (hepatitis A, B, C)
 Stomach pain (hepatitis B, C) 
 Yellow skin or eye whites, called jaundice (hepatitis A, B, C) 
 Pale or clay-coloured stool (hepatitis A, C) 
 Low-grade fever (hepatitis A, B, C) 
 
Loss of appetite (hepatitis A, B, C)
 
Fatigue (hepatitis A, B, C)
 Feeling sick to your stomach (hepatitis A, B, C) 
 
Aching joints (hepatitis B)

II. 
Preventions 

Prevention and control measures which can be adopted are listed below:- 

 Control of reservoir: - It is very difficult to achieve this because of poor sanitary facilities of 
the community and no specific treatment available to kill the organism.

 Control of transmission: - Spread of the infection can be controlled by strict personal 
hygiene, e.g. thorough hand washing with soap before eating and after going to the toilet; 
sanitary disposal of sewage to prevent contamination of drinking water and eatable.

 
 Control of susceptible population: - Susceptible population groups may seek medical advice 
for suitable control measures. Certain protective measures are available for specific 
susceptible groups and individuals at risk.

 Administration of vaccine: - The other control measure is the vaccine. Vaccines against 
infective hepatitis have been developed but are still in clinical trials stage and it may take 
some more time before they are widely used in the prevention of infectious hepatitis.
 
 
MANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS & DIETETICS: 
 
Majority of the patients with Hepatitis do not required drastic interventions. It is advisable to 
encourage patients to consume a normal diet. However, patients consuming alcohol are 
mostly malnourished and hence required serious nutritional interventions. 
 
Nutritional Management 
 
The objective of nutritional management of hepatitis are: 
i) 
to relieve symptoms 
ii) 
to aid in the regeneration of liver tissues 
iii) 
to prevent further liver damage 
 
A high protein, high carbohydrate moderate fat is recommended. Small attractive meals at 
regular intervals are better tolerated. Overfeeding should be avoided. 
 
 
1. Proteins: -For the liver cells to regenerate an adequate supply of proteins is needed. With 
severe jaundice, 40 g while in mild jaundice 60-80 g of protein is permitted. 
 
2. Fats: - Fats make the food more palatable and increase calorie intake. In severe jaundice 20 g 
and in moderate jaundice 20-30 g of fats per day are recommended. In other cases of 
jaundice, fate needs to be restricted only if there is obstruction to fat digestion and produces 
fatty diarrhea. 
 
3. Carbohydrates: -High carbohydrates content in the diet is essential to supply enough 
calories so that tissue proteins are not broken down for energy purpose. When fever, nausea 
and vomiting are present, intravenous glucose is suggested. As soon as the patient can take 
oral feeds; intravenous feeding should be stopped and fruit juices, sugar, jaggery and honey 
are given not only to provide carbohydrate but also to supply adequate electrolytes. 
 
4. Vitamins: -They are essential to regenerate liver cells. 500 mg of vitamin C, 10 mg of 
vitamin K and supplements of B complex are essential to meet the daily needs. If anorexia, 
nausea or vomiting is there, the vitamins may be given by injection. 
 
5. Minerals: -If food is not taken orally then a careful watch should be kept on the sodium and 
potassium levels. Oral feeds of fruit juice, vegetable and meat soups with added salt, given 
orally or through a nasogastric tube help in maintaining the electrolyte balance. Normal level 
of sodium and potassium in the body fluids must be maintained through supplements. 
 
6. Foods included: - Cereal porridge, soft chapattis, breads rice, skimmed milk, tapioca, potato, 
yam, fruit, fruit juices, sugar, jaggery, honey, biscuits, soft custard without butter cream and 
non-stimulant beverages.

JAUNDICE 
 
Jaundice is a term given to yellow discoloration of the skin, mucus membranes, sclera and 
body tissue because of accumulation of bile pigments in the blood. Jaundice is a common 
symptom for all liver diseases. It results due to increase levels of bilirubin in the blood. 
Jaundice is clinically detected when the bilirubin level is above 2.0 to 2.5 mg/dl. (Normal 
level 0.2 to 0.8 mg/dl). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS: 
 
I. 
Causes: 
 
Damage to liver cells leads to increase in bilirubin resulting in jaundice. After 120 days of 
life, RBC are broken and through a complex chemical reaction, bilirubin is produced. This is 
excreted in stools and urine along with bile. Problems like increased destruction of RBC, 
decreased functioning of the liver or obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver can result in 
jaundice. The figure below shows the production of jaundice.

II. 
Common symptoms of jaundice include: 
 
 a yellow pigmentation of the skin and the whites of the eyes, normally starting at the 
head and spreading down the body

 pale stools
 the urine also appears dark yellow or brown in colour
 itchiness
 fatigue 
 abdominal pain
 weight loss
 vomiting
 fever 
 pale stools

III.Types of Jaundice 

There are three types of jaundice namely: 

1. 
Hemolytic jaundice 
 
It is also known as prehepatic jaundice. This relates to excessive destruction of RBC 
resulting in an increased bilirubin formation and anaemia. There is an increased 
unconjugated plasma bilirubin, which is excreted through the urine. This kind of 
jaundice is common in newborns, i.e. neonatal jaundice. 
 
2. 
Hepatic jaundice 
 
In this, there is a normal bilirubin production. The liver cannot convert fat soluble 
bilirubin to the water soluble form. Hence, there is a decreased conjugation leading to 
hepatocyte damage (jaundice). Failure of about 80% or more of hepatic function is 
observed. 

3. 
Obstructive Jaundice 
 
It is referred to as post – hepatic jaundice. This results from the interference of normal 
flow of bile into the duodenum due to stones, tumors or inflammation of mucosa of 
the duct. This results in a backflow of bile in to the blood stream and is circulated in 
the body giving a yellow color. 
 
 
 
MANAGEMENT OF JAUNDICE & DIETETICS 
 
To remove excess bilirubin a generous intake of water is necessary. Hence Requirement is of 
more than 3 – 4 litre in a day. Thus, initially when jaundice is diagnosed preference should be 
given to a clear liquid diet every two hourly. This reduces the load on liver. Clear liquid 
includes fruit juices, dal or rice water, vegetable stalk, vegetable soup or chicken broth. 
 
Once the patient tolerates this without any nausea or vomiting, start with a full liquid diet. 
This includes buttermilk, yogurt smoothie, liquid mixture of dal and rice or curd and rice or 
liquid porridge. 
 
Within a day or two, start with soft easy to digest food and very low in fat. Water intake must 
be over 3 litres throughout the course of jaundice. Soft khichadi, porridge, curd rice and 
upma should be good. Be generous with carbohydrates, as it is required to build liver cells. 
Avoid any oil as it is processed in liver, which is already compromised due to jaundice. 
Coconut oil or ghee can be used sparingly (1 – 2 teaspoon/day).

CHAPTER: 12 CELIAC DISEASE, LACTOSE INTOLERANCE & PEPTIC 
ULCER 
 
(DEFINITION,CAUSES,CLINICALSYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) 
 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
 
1. Define Celiac disease, Lactose Intolerance & Peptic ulcer. 
 
2. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, complications of the above mentioned diseases, and 
 
3. Describe the treatment and prevention with a main focus on diet therapy and dietary 
management. 
 
 
 
Malabsorption Syndrome 
 
Malabsorption syndrome is an alteration in the ability of the intestine to absorb nutrients 
adequately into the blood stream and it leads to severe malnutrition. Some common 
malabsorption syndromes are Celiac disease, Lactose Intolerance. 
 
CELIAC DISEASE 
 
Celiac disease often called gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a serious autoimmune disease that 
occurs in genetically predisposed people where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the 
small intestine. It is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people worldwide 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12.1 inflammation in small Intestine 
 
SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
 
I. 
Causes: 
 
Celiac disease is caused by an abnormal immune system reaction to the protein gluten, which 
is found in foods such as bread, pasta, cereals and biscuits. 
 
In the case of coeliac disease, immune system mistakes one of the substances that makes up 
gluten, called gliadin, as a threat to the body. The antibodies that are produced cause the 
surface of intestine to become inflamed (red and swollen). 
 
The surface of the intestine is usually covered with millions of tiny tube-shaped growths 
called villi. Villi increase the surface area of gut and help it to digest food more effectively. 
However, in celiac disease, the damage and inflammation to the lining of the gut flattens the 
villi, reducing their ability to help with digestion. 
 
II. 
Symptoms 
The signs and symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly and differ in children and adults. 
 
Digestive signs and symptoms for adults include: 
 
Diarrhoea
 
Fatigue
 
Weight loss
 
Bloating and gas
 
Abdominal pain
 
Nausea and vomiting
 
Constipation

However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have signs and symptoms 
unrelated to the digestive system, including: 

 
Anaemia, usually from iron deficiency
 
Loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or softening of bone (osteomalacia)
 
Itchy, blistery skin rash
 
Mouth ulcers
 
Headaches and fatigue

 
Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible 
problems with balance, and cognitive impairment

 
Joint pain
 
Reduced functioning of the spleen.

III. 
Physiological conditions: 
 
 
Children presenting with celiac disease often will experience a decline in both height 
and weight growth velocity resulting in a decrease in the growth percentiles.

 
Adults have diarrhea as a major symptom of celiac disease in approximately 50% of 
cases. They may also be diagnosed in the setting of anemia or osteoporosis.
 
 
IV. 
Complications 
 
Chronic and sever form of celiac disease patients are at risk for several complications. 
These complications are following: 
 
 
Anaemia
 
Dermatitis, herpetiformis

 
Vitamin D deficiency, inadequate calcium absorption
 
Vitamin K deficiency

 
Infertility, increases risk of abortion, delayed puberty, delayed growth
 
MANAGEMENT OF CELIAC DISEASE AND DIETETICS 
Treatment: 
 
At present, the only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. No medication exists 
that prevents damage or prevents the body from attacking the gut when gluten is present. 
Strict adherence to the diet helps the intestine heal, leading to resolution of all symptoms in 
most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun, can also eliminate the heightened 
risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer and in some cases sterility. The diet can be 
cumbersome; failure to comply with the diet may cause relapse. 
 
Dietitian input is generally requested to ensure the person is aware which foods contain 
gluten, which foods are safe, and how to have a balanced diet despite the limitations. Gluten-
free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten-containing 
foods. 
 
The term "gluten-free" is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather 
than a complete absence. The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain. Gluten-free 
diet improves healthcare-related quality of life, and strict adherence to the diet gives more 
benefit than incomplete adherence. Nevertheless, gluten-free diet doesn't completely 
normalize the quality of life 
 
Dietary guidelines in celiac disease: 
 
 Avoiding foods with gluten, a protein found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley, is critical in 
treating celiac disease. Removing gluten from diet will improve symptoms, heal damage to 
small intestine, and prevent further damage over time. Many healthy, gluten-free foods and 
products are available in the market. 
 
 Foods such as meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, rice, and potatoes without additives or seasonings 
do not contain gluten and are part of a well-balanced diet. Gluten-free types of bread, pasta, 
and other foods that are now easier to find in stores and at special food companies. Potato, 
rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour can be 
substituted in the diet of a celiac.

LACTOSE INTOLERANCE 
 
Lactose intolerance: The inability to digest lactose, a component of milk and some other 
dairy products. The basis for lactose intolerance is the lack of an enzyme called lactase in the 
small intestine. The most common symptoms of lactose intolerance are diarrhea, bloating, 
and gas. 
 
SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
 
 
I. 
Causes 
There are two main types of lactose intolerance, which have different causes. 
 
Primary Lactose Intolerance: 
 
Primary lactose intolerance is the most common. It is caused by a decrease in lactase 
production with age, so that lactose becomes poorly absorbed. 
 
Secondary lactose intolerance: 
 
This form of lactose intolerance occurs when your small intestine decreases lactase 
production after an illness, injury or surgery involving your small intestine. Among the 
diseases associated with secondary lactose intolerance are celiac disease, bacterial 
overgrowth and Crohn's disease. Another cause of lactase deficiency is secondary lactase 
deficiency. This type of deficiency is due to diseases that destroy the lining of the small 
intestine along with the lactase. An example of such a disease is celiac disease (sprue). 
 
 
 
Congenital or developmental lactose intolerance: 
 
It's possible, but rare, for babies to be born with lactose intolerance caused by a complete 
absence of lactase activity. This disorder is passed from generation to generation in a 
pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive, meaning that both the mother and the 
father must pass on the same gene variant for a child to be affected. Premature infants may 
also have lactose intolerance because of an insufficient lactase level. Lactase deficiency 
may occur because of a congenital absence (absent from birth) of lactase due to a mutation 
in the gene that is responsible for producing lactase. This is a very rare cause of lactase 
deficiency, and the symptoms of this type of lactase deficiency begin shortly after birth. 
 
 
II. 
Symptoms- 
 
A person with lactose intolerance will experience symptoms after consuming milk or some 
dairy product that contains lactose. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to a severe 
reaction, depending on how much lactase the person produces, and how much dairy 
products they consume. 
 
Symptoms include: 
 Flatulence 
 
Bloating
 
Abdominal pains
 
Nausea
 Diarrhoea 

The person may have a sudden urge to use the bathroom 1 to 2 hours after consuming lactose. 
In severe cases, dehydration may occur. 
 
The most common cause of lactase deficiency is a decrease in the amount of lactase that 
occurs after childhood and persists into adulthood, referred to as adult-type hypolactasia. This 
decrease in lactase is genetically programmed. 
 
MANAGEMENT OF LACTOSE INTOLERANCE AND DIETETICS 
 
 
Treatment: 
 
There's currently no way to boost body's production of lactase, but one can usually avoid 
the discomfort of lactose intolerance by: 
 
 Avoiding large servings of milk and other dairy products
 Including small servings of dairy products in your regular meals
 Eating and drinking lactose-reduced ice cream and milk

 Experimenting with an assortment of dairy products. Not all dairy products have 
the same amount of lactose. For example, hard cheeses, such as Swiss or cheddar, 
have small amounts of lactose and generally cause no symptoms.

 Buying lactose-reduced or lactose-free products.

 Using lactase enzyme tablets or drops. Tablets or drops containing the lactase enzyme 
(Dairy Ease, Lactaid, others) may help digest dairy products. Not everyone with 
lactose intolerance is helped by these products.
 
 
Reducing the dairy products doesn't mean that we can't get enough calcium. Calcium is found 
in many other foods, such as: 
 
 Broccoli
 Calcium-fortified products, such as breads and juices
 Milk substitutes, such as soy milk and rice milk
 Oranges
 Pinto beans

 Spinach
 
Also make sure to get enough vitamin D, which is typically supplied in fortified milk. Eggs, 
liver and yogurt also contain vitamin D, and body makes vitamin D in the sun. Even without 
restricting dairy foods, though, many adults don't get enough vitamin D. 
 
Dietary tips for planning a menu for lactose intolerance patient 
 
 avoid milk, paneer and milk based beverages or desserts
 all the food labels should be read before using, as that should be lactose free
 if nutrition supplement is given it should be lactose free
 
PEPTIC ULCERS 
 
A peptic ulcer is a sore on the lining of stomach or duodenum. Rarely, a peptic ulcer may 
develop just above stomach in oesophagus called as oesophageal ulcer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12.2 Stomach and duodenum with ulcer 
 
 
SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
 
I. 
Causes 
 
 long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as 
Aspirin and Ibuprofen 
 
 an infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori 
 
 Rare cancerous and noncancerous tumours in the stomach, duodenum, or 
pancreas— known as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) 
 
 Peptic ulcers occur when acid in the digestive tract eats away the inner surface 
of the stomach or small intestine. The acid can create a painful open sore that 
may bleed. Digestive tract is coated with a mucous layer that normally protects 
against acid. But if the amount of acid is increased or the amount of mucus is 
decreased, it could develop an ulcer.
 
Some other causes include: 
 
 A bacterium. Helicobacter pylori bacteria commonly lives in the mucous layer that 
covers and protects tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. Often, the H. 
pylori bacterium causes no problems, but it can cause inflammation of the stomach's 
inner layer, producing an ulcer.

 Regular use of certain pain relievers. Taking Aspirin, as well as certain nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can irritate or inflame the lining of stomach and 
small intestine. Peptic ulcers are more common in older adults who take these pain 
medications frequently or in people who take these medications for osteoarthritis.

 Other medications. Taking certain other medications along with NSAIDs, such as 
steroids, anticoagulants, low-dose Aspirin can greatly increase the chance of 
developing ulcers.
 
It is not uncommon for people to have a peptic ulcer and no symptoms at all. However, one 
of the most common symptoms of peptic ulcers is indigestion-like pain. The pain may occur 
anywhere from the belly button to the breastbone. It can be brief or may last for hours. It is 
more severe when the stomach is empty or right after eating (depending on where it is 
located); sometimes it is worse during sleep. Eating certain foods may relieve it, and some 
foods may make it worse. 
 
Other symptoms may include: 
 
 difficulty swallowing food
 food that is eaten comes back up
 feeling unwell after eating
 weight loss

 loss of appetite

 Over-the-counter medications can often provide relief for these symptoms. Rarely, 
ulcers can cause severe signs and symptoms, such as:

 vomiting blood
 black and tarry stools, or stools with dark red blood
 nausea and vomiting that is especially persistent and severe
 
 
MANAGEMENT OF PEPTIC ULCER & DIETETICS 
Treatment:- 
 
The type of treatment usually depends on what caused the peptic ulcer. Treatment will focus 
on either lowering stomach acid levels so that the ulcer can heal, or eradicating the H. pylori 
infection. 
 
H. pylori infection treatment 
 
Patients infected with H. pylori will usually need antibiotics. This treatment is effective in 
most patients, and the ulcer will start to disappear within days. When treatment is over, the 
individual will have to be tested again to make sure the H. pylori have gone. 
 
 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
 
If the ulcer comes from NSAIDs, the patient will have to stop taking them. If the person 
cannot stop taking NSAIDs, the doctor may minimize the dosage and review the patient's 
need for them later. 
 
Follow-up treatment 
 
Even after the ulcer has healed and treatment has been completed, the patient may still have 
indigestion. In such cases, the doctor might advise some diet and lifestyle changes. In severe 
cases with bleeding, an endoscopy may be needed to stop the bleeding at the ulcer site. 
 
Dietary Management: 
 
Dietary changes can be important for treating and preventing peptic ulcers. 
 
It is important to avoid foods and flavourings that induce the stomach to produce acids, such 
as chili powder, garlic, black pepper, and caffeine. Alcohol has the same effect on the 
stomach and should also be avoided. 
 
The diet should contain plenty of foods that provide plenty of vitamin A and fibre that 
dissolves easily. These can include: 
 
Sources of soluble fibre 
 
Oats

 
Apples
 
Oranges
 
 
Carrots
 
legumes
 
flax seeds
 
Nuts
 
Barley
 
Sources of vitamin A 
 
liver
 
broccoli
 kale 
 
spinach
 
sweet potatoes
 
 
Foods that are high in antioxidants, such as a range of berries and snap peas, are 
recommended. Green tea has also demonstrated a restrictive effect on the growth of H. pylori 
under laboratory conditions. A balanced diet filled with fruits and vegetables and lacking in 
intense spices and flavours should assist with a peptic ulcer.

Learning Objectives: 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
 
1. Define the term food hazards, 
 
2. Differentiate between different types of food hazards(physical ,chemical & biological), 
 
3. Explain the causes, concepts and preventive measures of cholera, typhoid & 
salmonellosis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13.1 Types of Food Hazards 
 
A general definition of a hazard is a conditions or contaminants that can cause illness or 
injury. A food hazard refers to any agent with the potential to cause adverse health 
consequences for consumers. It occurs when food is exposed to hazardous agents which 
result in contamination of that food. HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control point) is a 
food safety system that is recognised worldwide to determine significant hazards pertaining 
to specific products and processes. Food hazards may be biological, chemical and physical. 
Let’s now discuss these hazards in detail. 
 
1. Biological hazards: It includes microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, yeasts, 
molds and parasites. Some of these are pathogens or may produce toxins. A 
pathogenic microorganism causes disease and can vary in the degree of severity. 
Examples of biological hazards include Salmonella, E. coli and Clostridium 
botulinum. These hazards can come from raw materials or from food-processing steps 
used to make the final product. Microorganisms live everywhere: air, dirt, fresh and 
salt water, skin, hair, animal fur and plants. Microorganisms are classified into various 
groups. Since microorganisms are so widespread, it is important to understand when 
to be concerned about them and how to deal with them. Although thousands of kinds 
of microorganisms exist, only a few pose hazards to humans. Many microorganisms 
are beneficial. Certain kinds of yeast, molds and bacteria help make cheese, sour 
cream, yogurt and other fermented dairy products. Particular kinds of yeast are used in 
making beer, wine and other fermented beverages. We add these microorganisms to 
our foods intentionally, and they cause no harm. In fact, studies show that some of 
these microorganisms contribute to good health. In HACCP, "hazards" refer to 
conditions or contaminants in foods that can cause illness or injury. 
 
 
2. Chemical hazards: The chemical hazards vary in the aspect of production they are 
related to. Some potential chemical hazards could be prior to a processor receiving 
product, such as the improper use of pesticides or antimicrobial residues. Others could 
be chemicals used on processing equipment such as oils used on equipment or 
sanitizers. Furthermore, other potential chemical hazards may include substances that 
are safe or used in processing at certain levels but can cause illness or injury if 
consumed at too high of a concentration, such as sodium nitrite or antimicrobial 
solutions used in intervention steps. The HACCP team evaluates in the hazard 
analysis the likelihood of the chemical to cause illness or injury. Chemical 
contamination can happen at any stage in food production and processing. Chemicals 
can be helpful and are purposefully used with some foods, such as pesticides on fruits 
and vegetables. Packaging materials that are in direct contact with ingredients or the 
product can be a source of incidental chemicals, such as sanitizers or inks. Chemicals 
are not hazardous if properly used or controlled. 
 
3. Physical hazards: It include objects that are hard or sharp such as glass, metal, plastic, 
stones, pits, wood, or even bone. Physical hazards can lead to injuries such as 
choking, cuts, or broken teeth. Some foreign material in food products may not be a 
physical hazard but rather an undesirable foreign material such as hair, insects, or 
sand that are not likely to cause injuries. Physical hazards include any potentially 
harmful extraneous matter not normally found in food. When a consumer mistakenly 
eats the foreign material or object, it is likely to cause choking, injury or other adverse 
health effects. Physical hazards are the most commonly reported consumer complaints 
because the injury occurs immediately or soon after eating, and the source of the 
hazard is often easy to identify. 
 
 
 
FOOD BORNE DISEASE 
 
Food borne illness usually result from a few of the following reasons: 
 
1. Consuming food obtained from infected plant or animal. 
2. Food contaminated by insects, flies, rodents, etc. 
3. Food which comes in the contact with sewage water or sewage polluted water. 
4. Food handled in an unhygienic way. 
 
Microorganisms like salmonella, clostridium and staphylococci are responsible for the 
majority of food-borne illness. The main diseases which are transmitted by food are typhoid, 
dysentery, tuberculosis, infectious hepatitis and cholera. 
 
Some of the common symptoms of food illness are given below as food-borne illness 
generally affects the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain & diarrhoea. 
 
Food and Personal Hygiene: 
 
Hygiene is an important factor in order to prevent a food illness. It is so because food is the 
most potential medium through which disease- carrying organisms can be transmitted. So, it 
becomes important for food handlers to follow high standard of food hygiene. Hence one 
should follow the following practices: 
 
1. Wash your hands with soap or water. Dry them properly with a towel or a hand dryer. 
2. Keep your nails short and clean. 
 
3. If you have cut or wounds on hands or fingers, cover them with proper 
dressing before handling food. 
 
4. Do not touch hair, nose or any other potentially hazardous area or thing while 
preparing food 
 
5. Cover your mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing. 
6. Store the food at proper temperature. 
 
 
CHOLERA: 
 
Cholera is an acute infection of the small intestine that cause severe watery diarrhoea, which 
can lead to dehydration and even death, if untreated. It is caused by eating food or drinking 
water contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae. Cholera has been known and 
feared for centuries because of its occurrence in epidemics resulting in high mortality and 
social disruption. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13.2 Transmission of Cholera 
 
Causes: 
 
Vibrio cholerae is usually found in food or water contaminated by faces from a person with 
the infection. Common sources include: 
 
 Municipal water supplies
 Ice made from municipal water
 Foods and drinks sold by street vendors
 Vegetable grown with water containing human wastes

 Raw or undercooked fish and seafood caught in waters polluted with sewage
 
Incubation period: Incubation period for cholera infection is from few hours to 5 days, but 
commonly it is 1 to 2 days. 
 
 
Carriers in cholera: A carried is a person who is apparently healthy but is excreting the 
causative organism – Vibrio cholerae. 
 
Who gets the disease? 
 
Age & Sex: Cholera affects all ages, and both sexes. In areas, where cholera is endemic, 
children are affected most. 
 
Economic Status: Occurrence of cholera is more in the low socio-economic groups mainly 
because of poor hygiene. 
 
Immunity: Affected person gets temporary immunity from previous episodes for future 
attacks. Such immunity will however be effective from 10 days to 7 months only after the 
onset of an attack. 
 
Symptoms 
 Watery diarrhoea
 Vomiting
 Dehydration
 Rapid heart rate
 Loss of skin elasticity (the ability to return to original position quickly if pinched)
 Dry mucous membranes, including the inside of the mouth, throat, nose and eyelids

 Low blood pressure
 Thirst
 Reduce urine output
 Muscle cramps
 
Management, Prevention and Measures 
 
Management: Since dehydration is the most common manifestation of cholera the very first 
step in the management of cholera is control of dehydration. 
 
With rehydration i.e., by making up of losses fluids and salts (electrolytes) cholera can now 
be effectively treated. The rehydration can be oral or intravenous. By this treatment, the death 
rate due to cholera can be reduced to 1 percent. World Health organisation recommends the 
use of oral fluid. 
 
The amount of oral fluid given depends upon extent of dehydration. 
 
 In the case of mild dehydration i.e., the patient is thirsty, pulse is normal, tongue 
moist, skin pinch retracts immediately, and the volume of oral fluid to be given 
would be 50ml per kg body weight to be consumed within 4 hours.

 In case of moderate dehydration i.e., when the patient is thirsty, pulse is rapid and 
weak , eyes are sunken and tongue is dry and volume of oral fluid to be given should 
be 100 ml per kg body weight to be consumed within 4 hours.

 In case of severe dehydration i.e., when the patient is drowsy, cold, sweaty, pulse is 
feeble, blood pressure not recordable and skin pinch retracts very slowly, tongue is 
very dry, the patient must immediately be shifted to a nearby hospital.
 
 
PREVENTION AND CONTROL: 
 
Sanitation measure- 
 
1. Water control: As water is the most important vehicle for transmission of cholera, 
adequate steps must be taken for safe and adequate water supply. 
 
2. Excreta disposal: Economical and effective excreta disposal must be undertaken. 
 
3. Food sanitation: As food forms an important vehicle of infection, effective steps must 
be taken for proper food sanitation. 
 
4. Disinfections: The most effective disinfectant are cresol and bleaching powder. The 
patient stools, vomit, clothes and other items that have been contaminated must be 
disinfected. 
 
Vaccination-Vaccination against cholera as a specific prophylactic (medicine to prevent 
cholera) is available. Children below 5 yrs. who are main victims of cholera in endemic areas 
are poorly protected with the current vaccine, the degree of protection tends to increase with 
age. 
 
TYPHOID 
 
Typhoid is a bacterial infection that can lead to a high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Typhoid 
fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella typhi, usually through ingestion of 
contaminated food or water. It occurs predominantly in association with poor sanitation and 
lack of clean drinking water. 
 
Typhoid is manifested by fever with the gradual onset of headache, prolonged fever 
associated with anorexia. Non-sweating fever, mental dullness may be observed sometimes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13.3 Transmission of Typhoid 
 
Causes: 
 
A microorganism Salmonella typhi is the causative organism and mainly it affects the 
intestine and liberates toxins into blood circulation. 
 
The main mode of infection is by faecal-oral route. 
 
The typhoid infection mainly spread by water and food contaminated by faeces or urine of 
typhoid patients or carriers of the disease. There are certain social factors which contribution 
to the infection. These include: 
 
1. The prevailing wrong defecation practices because of which faecal pollution of soil 
occurs leading to spread of infection through water, food and flies. 
 
2. Low standard of personal hygiene. 
3. Unhygienic health practices. 
4. Low standards of food hygiene. 
5. Illiteracy and health ignorance. 
 
 
Carriers in Typhoid: A small number who have suffered from typhoid may become carriers. 
The carriers may excrete the organism in faeces, urine or bile. 
 
Incubation period: The disease takes usually 10-15 days with a range of 4 days to 3 weeks. 
 
Period of communicability: Period of communicability for typhoid lasts as long as typhoid 
bacilli appear in the excreta. 
 
Generally everybody is susceptible to the disease typhoid. Resistance to small infecting doses 
follows recovery from clinical disease or from unapparent (sub-clinical) infection or from 
active immunization. In areas where typhoid is endemic attack rates usually decline with age. 
 
Management, Prevention and Measures 
 
Three lines of measures can be described against the control and prevention of typhoid fever. 
They are: 
 
1. Control of reservoir: The reservoir of infection for typhoid fever exists in patients, 
contacts and carriers. Isolation of cases is essential to prevent the spread of the 
infection. Appropriate treatment should be ensured by proper medical care. Since 
patient’s stools, urine and is articles are the main sources of infection in typhoid fever, 
they should be properly disinfected. 
 
2. Control of sanitation: Following measures are included: 
 
 Protection, purification and chlorination of public water supplies.
 Sanitary disposal of human excreta.
 Control of fly breeding.
 Boiling or pasteurisation of milk and dairy products.
 Identification and adequate supervision of typhoid carriers.
 
 
3. Immunization: Vaccine is available for immunization against typhoid fever. While 
improved sanitation ad strict domestic and personal hygiene are primary in preventing 
typhoid, immunization has a complimentary role. Though immunization does not 
offer 100 percent protection against typhoid, it has got a major role in prevention. 
 
 
Management 
 
In case of any prolonged fever, it is essential to seek proper medical attention. Once the 
diagnosis of the disease is confirmed clinically and bacteriologically (biochemically) specific 
treatment should be administered under strict medical care. It is essential that medical 
treatment for typhoid should be under strict medical care. 
 
 
Proper nutrition and dietary care should be taken since the gastro-intestinal system is 
involved. Authentic advice from qualified medical people should be obtained. 
 
SALMONELLOSIS 
 
Salmonella infection (salmonellosis) is a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal 
tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through 
faeces. Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food. 
 
Typically, people with salmonella infection have no symptoms. Others develop diarrhoea, 
fever and abdominal cramps within eight to 72 hours. Most healthy people recover within a 
few days without specific treatment. 
 
In some cases, the diarrhoea associated with salmonella infection can be so dehydrating as to 
require prompt medical attention. Life-threatening complications also may develop if the 
infection spreads beyond your intestines. The risk of acquiring salmonella infection is higher 
if you travel to countries with poor sanitation. 
 
Causes: 
 
Salmonella bacteria live in the intestines of people, animals and birds. Most people are 
infected with salmonella by eating foods that have been contaminated by faeces. Commonly 
infected foods include: 
 
 Raw meat, poultry and seafood. Faeces may get onto raw meat and poultry 
during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from 
contaminated water.

 Raw eggs. While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to 
contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella 
before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of 
mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.

 
Fruits and vegetables. Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may 
be hydrated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with 
salmonella. Contamination also can occur in the kitchen, when juices from raw meat 
and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads.
 
Management, Prevention and Measures 
 
 
Preventive methods are especially important when preparing food or providing care for 
infants, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Be sure to cook food 
thoroughly and refrigerate or freeze food promptly. 
 
Wash your hands 
 
Washing your hands thoroughly can help prevent the transfer of salmonella bacteria to your 
mouth or to any food you're preparing. Wash your hands after you: 
 
 
Use the toilet
 
Change a diaper
 
Handle raw meat or poultry
 
Clean up pet faeces
 
Touch reptiles or birds
 
Keep things separate 
To prevent cross-contamination: 
 
 
Store raw meat, poultry and seafood away from other foods in your refrigerator

 
If possible, have two cutting boards in your kitchen — one for raw meat and the 
other for fruits and vegetables

 
Never place cooked food on an unwashed plate that previously held raw meat
 
Avoid eating raw eggs 
 
Cookie dough, homemade ice cream and eggnog all contain raw eggs. If you must 
consume raw eggs, make sure they've been pasteurized.

CHAPTER 14: PERSONAL HYGIENE & FOOD HYGIENE 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
1. Define the terms food hygiene, food safety & food sanitation, 
2. Enumerate the scope of environmental sanitation, 
3. List the various habits included in maintenance of personal hygiene. 
 
 
 
The human body can provide places for disease-causing germs and parasites to grow and 
multiply. These places include the skin and in and around the openings to the body. It is less 
likely that germs and parasites will get inside the body if people have good personal hygiene 
habits. Maintaining personal hygiene is essential for more than one reason; social, health, 
personal, psychological or just as a way of life. Maintaining a good standard of hygiene helps 
keep infections, illnesses and bad odors at bay. The importance of hygiene should be taught 
from an early age to help cultivate good habits. Personal hygiene can be defined as an act of 
maintaining cleanliness and grooming of the external body. Maintaining good personal 
hygiene consists of bathing, washing your hands, brushing teeth and sporting clean clothing. 
Additionally, it is also about making safe and hygienic decisions when you are around others. 
 
One of the most fool proof ways to safeguard yourself and others from illness is through 
good personal hygiene. This means cleaning your hands, especially, but additionally your 
body. Good personal hygiene not only enhances your overall appearance, its importance is 
directly related to prevention of diseases, infections, and unpleasant odours. 
 
GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE 
 
Good personal hygiene habits include: 
 
 Washing the body often. If possible, everybody should have a shower or a bath every 
day. However, there may be times when this is not possible, for example, when people 
are out camping or there is a shortage of water
 If this happens, a swim or a wash all over the body with a wet sponge or cloth will do

 Cleaning the teeth at least once a day. Brushing the teeth after each meal is the best way 
of making sure that gum disease and tooth decay are avoided. It is very important to 
clean teeth after breakfast and immediately before going to bed
 washing the hair with soap or shampoo at least once a week

 washing hands with soap after going to the toilet

 Washing hands with soap before preparing and/or eating food. During normal daily 
activities, such as working and playing, disease causing germs may get onto the hands 
and under the nails. If the germs are not washed off before preparing food or eating, 
they may get onto the food

 Changing into clean clothes. Dirty clothes should be washed with laundry soap before 
wearing them again

 Hanging clothes in the sun to dry. The sun's rays will kill some disease-causing germs 
and parasites

 Turning away from other people and covering the nose and mouth with a tissue or the 
hand when coughing or sneezing. If this is not done, droplets of liquid containing germs 
from the nose and mouth will be spread in the air and other people can breathe them in, 
or the droplets can get onto food.
 
Types of personal hygiene 
 
Each person’s idea of personal hygiene differs. These main categories are a useful place to 
start for building good hygiene habits: 
 
Toilet hygiene 
 
Wash your hands after you use the restroom. Scrub with soap for 20 to 30 seconds, and be 
sure to clean between your fingers, on the back of your hands, and under your nails. Rinse 
with warm water, and dry with a clean towel. 
 
If you don’t have running water or soap, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer will also work. Use 
one that’s at least 60 percent alcohol. 
 
 
Shower hygiene 
 
Personal preference may dictate how often you wish to shower, but most people will benefit 
from a rinse at least every other day. Showering with soap helps rinse away dead skin cells, 
bacteria, and oils. 
 
You should also wash your hair at least twice a week. Shampooing your hair and scalp helps 
remove skin build up and protects against oily residues that can irritate your skin. 
 
Nail hygiene 
 
Trim your nails regularly to keep them short and clean. Brush under them with a nail brush or 
washcloth to rinse away build up, dirt, and germs. 
 
Tidying your nails helps you prevent spreading germs into your mouth and other body 
openings. You should also avoid biting your nails. 
 
Teeth hygiene 
 
Good dental hygiene is about more than just pearly white teeth. Caring for your teeth and 
gums is a smart way to prevent gum diseases and cavities. 
 
Brush at least twice a day for 2 minutes. Aim to brush after you wake up and before bed. If 
you can, brush after every meal, too. Floss between your teeth daily, and ask your dentist 
about using an antibacterial mouthwash. 
 
These two steps can help prevent tooth decay and eliminate pockets where bacteria and 
germs can build up. 
 
Sickness hygiene 
 
If you’re not feeling well, you should take steps to keep from spreading germs to others. This 
includes covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, wiping down shared surfaces with an 
antibacterial wipe, and not sharing any utensils or electronics. Also, immediately throw away 
any soiled tissues. 
 
Hands hygiene 
 
Germs on your hands can easily enter your body through your mouth, nose, eyes, or ears. 
Wash your hands: 
 
 
when you handle food
 
before you eat
 
if you handle garbage
 
when you sneeze
 
any time you touch an animal
 
 
Likewise, wash your hands after changing a baby’s diaper, helping someone clean 
themselves, or when cleaning a cut or wound. 
 
 
FOOD HYGIENE AND SANITATION 
 
Food hygiene is the conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety of food from 
production to consumption. Food can become contaminated at any point during slaughtering 
or harvesting, processing, storage, distribution, transportation and preparation. Lack of 
adequate food hygiene can lead to foodborne diseases and death of the consumer. Food 
hygiene constitutes a basic necessity of Good Manufacturing/Agricultural Practices and the 
development of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP).The personal cleanliness 
and hygiene of food preparers are critical to protecting against foodborne illness. In addition 
to regular hand washing, some states require food preparers to wear latex gloves as an 
additional safeguard. Clean hair and clean clothing are essential. If a food preparer is dirty, 
the risk for food contamination increases greatly. Food sanitation and hygiene guidelines 
require food preparers to wear hats, hairnets and beard guards to make sure that hair doesn't 
contaminate food. Similarly, wearing aprons outside the food preparation area isn't permitted 
since bacteria are so easily carried back to the kitchen. 
 
Food sanitation is essential aspect of food preparation. Food sanitation implies: 
 
 Cleanliness
 Preparing
 Storing &
 Serving of food & water
 
Some items that need particular attention are: 
 
 A safe and potable water supply

 Selection of wholesome ingredients &
 Hygienic handling
 
Water is essential in food preparation. Water is used to wash food before cooking. Clean the 
containers make beverage. It should be free from pathogenic bacteria. Water is potable if 
 
 It is free from pathogenic bacteria
 It is free from harmful bacteria
 It contains dissolved salts or minerals
 
ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION AND SAFETY 
 
It is generally accepted that the assurance of food safety is primarily connected with the 
elimination of contamination in the full cycle of food production, from raw materials through 
manufacturing to finished products and kitchen operations. Among potential contaminants, 
primarily pesticides, heavy metals, and some biological contaminants have to be taken in 
consideration. The majority of these contaminants are of environmental origin. So it is 
understandable that a prerequisite of the production of safe food is the hindering of pollution 
in the environment. In this chapter some aspects of interrelations of food safety and 
environmental sanitation will be treated. 
 
Integrated Pest Management and Food Safety 
 
The last 40 years of the twentieth century saw a remarkable scientific revolution in 
agriculture, in which chemical technology played a major role. A broad range of chemicals is 
 
 
now used in agriculture to reduce the losses caused by different pests. Pests—including 
insects, mites, pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms), weeds, nematodes, rodents, and 
others—contribute to high farm-producing costs and reduced quality and yields. Farm 
production losses to pests are estimated to exceed 35% annually. So it is understandable that 
reduction of these losses by using different chemicals is important from the point of view of 
increasing the effectiveness of agricultural production. The use of chemicals in agricultural 
production has provided numerous benefits in terms of increasing production and quality. 
However, as a result, consumers are exposed indirectly to chemicals, usually in minute 
quantities. Although the level of residues in food is low, they represent an additional health 
hazard for people consuming residue containing food. Because some types of these 
chemicals, such as organo-chlorine pesticides, heavy metals, and triazine herbicides, could 
not be degraded by naturally occurring soil microorganisms, the soil and water could also be 
polluted. In addition, it should be mentioned that because of transformation of pesticides in 
plants and soil, different metabolites are formed. Some of them may also be toxic. 
 
For pesticides, less than 1% of all the wells surveyed had concentrations slightly above levels 
considered safe for human health, while about 1% of the community wells and about 2.4% of 
the private rural wells contained nitrate concentrations above the maximum contaminant level 
established to protect human health. 
 
Any harmful health effects of pesticides are usually associated with the amount or dose of the 
pesticide. For example, a chemical worker who during manufacture of a pesticide harmful to 
humans accidentally comes into direct contact with large amounts of the pesticide could face 
serious injury. Yet, because the danger is so great, strict safety requirements have drastically 
reduced the likelihood of such an industrial accident occurring. 
 
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecological approach to pest suppression. 
Establishment of an integrated pest suppression system should be based on thorough 
knowledge of: 
 
 Crop and animal production methods

 Biology and ecology of each pest species and basic information on the genetics and 
physiology of pest species

 Relationships of the pests with the crop and other biological and physiological 
components of the ecosystem

 Potential economic damage of each pest and pest complex

 The issue of food safety and hygiene is a universal concern. This is because everyone 
has to consume food. This is a requirement for all people across the nation as well as 
the globe to be concerned about to be healthy and enjoy the food they must consume.

CHAPTER-15: FOOD ADULTERATION 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
1. Explain the terms food adulteration, and list the common adulterants 
 
2. Demonstrate the common methods for testing adulterants at home, 
3. List the various standards as set by FSSAI for food products. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
For good health, we must have good food. By good food, we mean nutritionally balanced, 
wholesome and safe food. Adulteration in food products is a part of under nutrition. 
Adulteration leads to loss of nutrients in food products and sometimes may prove very 
harmful for the body. Moreover, the consumer is cheated not only for his money by 
adulteration but also in quantity and quality as well. 
 
Adulteration of food stuffs is commonly practised in India by the trade. The consumers like to 
get maximum quantity for a price as low as possible. The sellers must meet the needs of the 
buyers, to be able to exist. This is a vicious cycle. When the price of food production is 
higher than the price which the consumer is prepared to pay, seller is compelled to supply 
food product of inferior quality. Thus, adulteration occurs. 
 
Food adulteration can be defined as the intentional addition or substitution or abstraction of 
substance which adversely affect the nature, substance and quality of food products. It can be 
at the time of harvesting, storage, processing, transportation or distribution. 
 
TYPES OF ADULTERATION 
 
Adulteration may be intentional or unintentional. The former is a wilful act on the part of the 
adulterator intended to increase the margin of profit. Incidental contamination is usually due 
to ignorance, negligence or lack of proper facilities. 
 
A. Intentional adulterants: Intentional adulterants are sand, marble chips, stones mud, 
chalk powder, water, mineral oil and coaltar, dyes. These adulterants cause harmful 
effects on the body. 
 
B. Incidental adulterants: Raw foods such as meat, fish, milk and vegetables grown on 
sewage are likely to be contaminated with harmful micro-organisms. These are 
generally destroyed during cooking or processing of food. Some of the micro-
organisms may survive due to inadequate heat processing. Further, some of the foods, 
if consumed in the raw state, may cause food poisoning. Recent studies have shown 
that food grains legumes and oil seeds when stored in humid atmosphere are infected 
by pathogenic fungus which can cause serious illness. 
 
 
To check the growing tendency of food adulteration, Government of India had introduced 
“Prevention of Food Adulteration Act” (PFA) in 1954. This Act is based on international 
standards, keeping in mind the Indian conditions. This Act came into force on June 1, 1955. 
 
FSSAI (FOOD SAFETY AND STANDARD AUTHORITY OF INDIA) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 15.1: FSSAI symbol 
 
 
In 2006, the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) has been established 
under the food safety and standard Act, 2006 which consolidates various acts. 
 
The Act has laid down science based standards for articles of food and regulates their 
manufacture, storage, distribution, and import to ensure availability of safe and wholesome 
food for human consumption and for matter and incidents connected therewith. The 
following foodstuffs should be deemed to be adulterated:- 
 
1. If it is not of the nature, substance, and quality which it ought to be. 
 
2. If it contains cheaper or inferior ingredients incidentally or intentionally. 
 
3. If it has been prepared by a process which alters the nature, substance, or quality of 
foodstuff. 
 
4. If any constituent has been abstracted partially or wholly from it like abstraction of 
cream from milk. 
 
5. If it has been prepared, packed, or kept under unsanitary conditions. 
 
6. If it is infected with insects, worms, etc. 
 
7. If it is obtained from sick or diseased animal, e.g., milk and meat of diseased animals. 
 
8. If it contains poisonous ingredients which are injurious to health. 
 
9. If the container renders it poisonous or injurious to health. 
 
10. If it contains unpermitted colours or any excessive amount of permitted ones. 
 
11. If it contains prohibited preservatives or an excessive amount of permitted ones. 
 
12. If it does not satisfy the prescribed standards laid down by the authorities even though 
they do not have adverse effect of health. 
 
STANDARDS: 
 
Standards framed by FSSAI are prescribed under Food Safety and Standards (Food Product 
Standards and Food Additives) Regulation, 2011, Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and 
Labelling) Regulation, 2011 and Food Safety and Standards (Contaminants, Toxins, and 
Residues) Regulations, 2011. 
 
The FSSAI has prescribed standards for following food products: 
 
 
 Dairy products and analogues 
 
 Fats, oils and fat emulsions 
 
 Fruits and vegetable products 
 
 Cereal and cereal products 
 
 
Meat and meat products

 Fish and fish products 
 
 
Sweets & confectionery

 
Sweetening agents including honey

 Salt, spices, condiments and related products 
 
 Beverages, (other than dairy and fruits & vegetables based) 
 
 
Other food product and ingredients

 
Proprietary food

 
Irradiation of food
 
The development of standards is a dynamic process based on the latest developments in food 
science, food consumption pattern, new food products and additives, changes in the 
processing technology leading to changed specifications, advancements in food analytical 
methods, and identification of new risks or other regulatory options. 
 
If a food product violates one or more of the above said standards, it will be regarded as an 
adulterated food and the seller will be punished under the law. 
 
According to PFA Act, Food Adulteration includes:- 
 
 Intentional addition, substitution or abstraction or substances which adversely affect 
the purity and quality of foods.

 Incidental contamination of foods with deleterious substances such as toxins and 
insecticides due to ignorance, negligence or lack of proper storage facilities.

 Contamination of the food with harmful insects, micro-organisms like bacteria, 
fungus, moulds, etc. during production, storage and handling.
 
Adulteration of food may endanger health if the physiological functions of the consumer are 
affected due to either addition or the removal of a vital component. 
 
Adulterant is any material which is employed or which could be employed for the purpose 
of adulteration is defined as an adulterant.

ILL EFFECTS OF ADULTERANTS 
 
In the earlier times, people used to prepare different eatables at home so that it is fresh, 
clean and healthy. But today everyone is so busy that they do not have time to cook food 
at home and rely on instantly made items. These have different kinds of preservatives that 
are used to keep them in good condition for a long time. But these are really harmful and 
have an adverse effect on our health. Today almost all the food items that you will get in 
the market have some or the other kind of adulterant which brings down the nutritional 
value and causes different types of health hazards. Let’s know more about adulteration 
and how it is harmful to your health. 
 
1. METANIL YELLOW 
 
Metanil yellow is a food colorant used extensively in various foods. It is also used as an 
adulterant in different spices especially turmeric and regular Indian foods like pulses. Metanil 
yellow belongs to “non-permitted” category of food colour. Continued consumption of this 
toxic food color leads to adverse life-threatening effects in humans. Consumption of metanil 
yellow in food may affect our nervous system and may cause brain damage. Metanil yellow 
consumed through food enters our digestive system directly. Studies reveal that metanil 
yellow causes  gastrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and damages the intestine. 
 
2. ARGEMONE OIL 
 
Consumption of adulterated mustard oil (Brassica nigra) with argemone oil (Argemone 
mexicana) even for a short duration leads to a clinical condition referred as epidemic dropsy. 
In humans, argemone oil contained in adulterated mustard oil causes oxidative stress and 
death of red blood cells via met-hemoglobin formation by altering pyridine nucleotide(s) and 
glutathione redox potential. Argemone oil contamination poses a serious threat to human 
health. 
 
3. KESARI DAL 
 
Excessive consumption of kesari dal produces Lathyrism (form of crippling, paralysis of both 
lower limbs) mainly in boys and men in the age group of 5 to 45 years. This disease 
manifests itself in 2-4 months if the diet consists of 40% or more of kesari dal. 
 
 The disease starts with the stiffness of knee joints and legs, with pain around the knee 
and ankle joints.

 Within 10-30 days of the onset of symptoms, paralysis of the lower limbs sets in.
 The patient gradually becomes crippled as his knees are bent and stiff.

CHAPTER 16: READING AND UNDERSTANDING FOOD LABELS 
 
 
Learning Objectives: 
 
After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 
1. Explain the term Food Label and its importance, 
 
2. List the advantages and disadvantages of food labels. 
 
3. Elaborate on the labelling provision in existing food laws. 
 
 
 
A food label can be defined as a panel found on a package of food which contains a variety of 
information about the nutritional value of the food item. There are many pieces of 
information which are standard on most food labels, including serving size, number of 
calories, grams of fat, included nutrients, and a list of ingredients. This information helps 
people who are trying to restrict their intake of fat, sodium, sugar, or other ingredients, or 
those individuals who are trying to get enough of the healthy nutrients such as calcium or 
Vitamin C. 
 
 
Food label is any tag, brand, mark, pictorial or other descriptive matter, written, printed, 
stencilled, marked, embossed or impressed on, or attached to, a container of food. Food 
labelling includes any written, printed or graphic matter that is present on the label, 
accompanies the food, or is displayed near the food, including that for the purpose of 
promoting its sale or disposal. The label may either be engraved or attached on to the 
packaging of the product.

ADVANTAGES OF A FOOD LABEL 
 
 Labels assist a consumer in making a wise decision.

 The label provides detailed information about a food’s nutrient content.

 You can use the label compare two similar foods to decide what would be the 
healthier choice.

 The list of ingredients is essential in case a person is allergic to some ingredient.

 They also help to see the quality of the product through the given standardised marks.

 The rates and the amounts can be checked and compared.

 In case of any defect the manufacturer can be contacted directly through the address 
given.

 A consumer can refer the label as and when required.

 Any special scheme offered by the manufacturer is also mentioned on the label.

 Labels guide the consumers how to store and use the products.

LIMITATIONS OF A FOOD LABEL. 

 Labels may not give complete information.

 The print may be blurred, small or overlapping.

 Labels of popular brands may be initiated in case of sub-standard products.
 
 
 
 
HOW TO READ A FOOD LABEL 
 
Most foods in the grocery store have a nutrition facts label and list of ingredients. When you 
go for grocery shopping, take the time to read the nutrition facts labels on the foods you 
purchase. Compare nutrients and calories in one food to those in another. The information 
may surprise you. Make sure you are not buying foods high in calories, saturated and trans 
fats, sodium and added sugars. 
 
INFORMATION OF THE NUTRITION FACTS PROVIDED BY LABEL 
 
 Serving Size — This is how much of the food is considered a “serving”. A package 
may contain multiple servings. If you eat more or less than the serving size listed, you 
need to adjust the amount of nutrients and calories you are eating.

 Calories — This tells you how much energy is in the food. It is helpful to know if you 
are cutting calories to lose weight or want to manage your weight.

 Total Fat — This is the amount of fat found in one serving of the food. It includes the 
amount of “bad fats” (saturated and trans fats) and “better fats” (monounsaturated and 
polyunsaturated fats). Fat is higher in calories than protein or carbohydrates. So, cutting 
back on your fat intake will help you reduce the amount of calories you eat.

 Saturated Fat — Eating too much of these “bad fats” can raise your cholesterol and 
your risk of heart disease and stroke. Limit your saturated fat intake to less than 5 to 6 
percent of your total calories. For a person who needs 2,000 calories a day, this is about 
11 to 13 grams of saturated fat.

 Trans Fat – These fats are also considered “bad fats” because they can raise LDL

(LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN) cholesterol and risk of heart disease. Choose foods 
 
 
with “0” grams of trans fat and read the ingredients list to avoid foods made with 
“hydrogenated oils”. Everyone can benefit by limiting trans fats. 
 
 Cholesterol — The FDA’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating less 
than 300 mg of cholesterol a day to maintain normal cholesterol levels. They also 
recommend consuming less than 200 mg per day if you are at high risk for (or have) 
heart disease.

 Sodium — Watch for both naturally-occurring and added sodium in food products. Salt 
is sodium chloride. Most people should take in less than 1,500 mg of sodium each day.

That’s equal to a little more than ½ tsp. of salt. 

 Total Carbohydrates — A carbohydrate is a type of sugar. Carbohydrates in food are 
digested and converted into glucose, or sugar, to provide the cells of the body with 
energy. Choose carbohydrate-based foods with high amounts of nutrients. These 
include vegetables, fruits and whole-grain, breads, cereals and pasta.

 Dietary Fibre — Dietary fibre describes several materials that make up the parts of 
plants your body can’t digest. As part of a healthy diet, soluble fibre can help decrease 
your risk of heart disease and some types of cancer. Whole grains and fruits and 
vegetables include dietary fibre. Most refined (processed) grains contain little fibre.

 Sugar — The amount listed includes both sugars that occur naturally in foods, such as 
fruit and milk, and sugars that are added to foods, such as soft drinks and other 
sweetened foods and beverages. There are lots of different names for “added sugars” 
such as sucrose, fructose, glucose, maltose, dextrose, high-fructose corn syrup, corn 
syrup, concentrated fruit juice, and honey. Look at the ingredients list and make sure 
that there aren’t a lot of “added sugars” listed in the

 Protein — This is one of the components in food that provide us with energy. Animal 
protein contains saturated fat. Choose fish and skinless poultry and limit your intake of 
red meat. Use low-fat dairy products. Try other sources of protein such as beans, nuts, 
seeds, tofu and other soy-based products.

 Vitamins and Minerals — Vitamins and minerals are important parts of your diet. 
Eating a variety of foods will help you reach your daily goal of 100 percent of vitamin 
A, vitamin C, calcium and iron.

 Daily Value — The standard daily values are guides for people who eat 2,000 calories 
each day. If you eat more or less than that, your daily value may be higher or lower.
 
 
IMPORTANCE OF A FOOD LABEL. 
 
Ensuring food safety is a shared responsibility between governments, producers, industry and 
consumers. Food labelling is one way in which consumers can get knowledge about the food 
they consider buying. Correctly following the information provided on food labels (such as 
expiry dates, handling instructions and allergy warnings) can help consumers prevent 
unnecessary food-borne illness and allergic reactions. 
 
Reading food labels will make it much easier for you to compare foods and find the foods 
that have the nutritional value your child needs. It will help you and your family make 
healthy choices about the foods you are buying. 
 
Food labels can help you limit the amount of fat, sugar and cholesterol in your diet by 
making it easy for you to compare one food item with another and choose the one with lower 
 
 
amounts. Conversely, you can use food labels to find food items higher in vitamins, fibre and 
protein. 
 
The nutritional information found on a food label is based on one serving of that particular 
food. That is one of the most common mistakes people make when reading food labels. A 
food label may indicate that a food has 100 calories and only 5 grams of sugar, for example. 
But if you look at the number of servings, it may state three. That means that if you were to 
eat the entire package, you would be getting three times the amount shown on the food label. 
In this example, 300 calories and 15 grams of sugar. Don't be fooled, always look at what 
makes one serving (which the food label information is based on) and how many servings in 
that package 
 
 
STANDARD/CERTIFICATION MARK 
 
This is a mark given to a product which meets certain standards with respect to the quality of 
the product in terms of: 
 
 Material used

 Method of manufacturing

 Packing

 Sale

 Performance
 
The standard mark indicates that a product has been produced in accordance with the norms 
laid down by the standardising agency. Standard marks also encourage manufacturers to 
provide better competition in the market and also upgrade the quality of their products. 
 
STANDARD MARKS WITH REFERENCE TO FOOD PRODUCTS 
 
A. ISI MARK 
                                                
 
 
 It is a certification mark given by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). INDIAN 
STANDARD INSTITUITION (ISI) prescribes standards for product specification, 
methods of testing, etc.

 It develops consciousness among manufacturers and encourages them to produce 
quality products.

 It gives the manufacturers licences to use the ISI mark. This is given only after 
ensuring that the manufacturer is capable of producing the products as per the 
requirement on the continuous basis.

 The quality is maintained right from the raw material through the process to the 
finished product. This ensures that the finished product is in the conformity to the laid 
down standards.

 It also publishes many informative pamphlets and booklets on standards relating to 
many products.

 ISI mar is given to – custard powder, common salt, baking powder, cocoa, milk 
powder, condensed milk, wafers, coffee, ice cream, chewing gum, drinking chocolate, 
mineral water, etc.
B.AGMARK
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This was set up by Directorate of Marketing and Inspection of Government of India. 
It establishes norms for agricultural and livestock product at natural and processed 
stages.

 It categorises commodities into various grades depending on the degree of purity. 
These grades re 1,2,3,4 or extra-large, large, medium, small, etc.

 These standards also specify the type of packing to be used for different products for 
example special egg trays, milk polybags, oil bags or cartons.

 AG MARK is given to: Ghee, butter, oil, wheat flour, rice, powdered sugar, spices, 
eggs, fruits, etc.
 
 
B. FPO (FRUIT PRODUCT ORDER) 
C. 
 
 
 It lays minimum standards relating to the quality of various preserved foods made 
from fruits and vegetables.

 It lays standard of hygiene and sanitation.

 It lays minimum standards that must be maintained throughout the farming, 
manufacturing, processing and retailing of the product.

 It also gives instructions for packaging, labelling and temperatures of food containers.

 FPO is given to- pickles, jams, jellies, ketchup, frozen and canned food.
 
NUTRITION LABELLING 
 
The food industry contributes to nutrition education by offering products that correspond to 
the current needs of the consumer and by informing them about product ingredients and 
nutritional characteristics. Nutrition labelling refers to the standardised presentation of 
nutrient content of the food. 
 
Generally, the claims fall into some broad categories 
 
 NUTRITION CLAIMS- They can be categorised as representations which state, 
suggest or imply that a food has particular nutritional properties including energy value, 
content of protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. List of ingredients and 
mandatory declaration cannot be treated as a nutrition claim.

 NUTRIENT CONTENT CLAIM- This is a nutrition claim that describes the level of 
a nutrient contained in a food for example- low in fat, rich in iron or low sodium.

 COMPARITIVE CLAIM- It is a claim that compares nutrient levels or energy value 
of two or more foods. The foods being compared should be different versions of same 
food or similar food. The difference in nutrient content and energy value should be 
given.

 NUTRIENT FUNCTION CLAIM- This is a claim that describes the physiological 
role of a nutrient in the growth, development and normal function of the body e.g. 
contains calcium for stronger teeth.
 
GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF NUTRITION LABELLING 
 
 
 To make nutrition labelling useful, available and accessible to consumers. At 
the same time, they should be clear, simple, accurate, practical, readable, 
informative, consistent and legible.

 The serving size should be realistic.
 
LABELLING PROVISIONS IN EXISTING FOOD LAWS 
 
THE FOOD SAFETY AND STANDARDS ACT, 2006 
 
Under this Act every package of food shall carry a label giving the following information: 
 
 The name, trade name or description of food contained in the package.

 The name of ingredients used in the product in descending order of their composition 
by weight or by volume as the case maybe.

 In case, both colour and flavours are used in the product, the label should mention.

 If gelatin is used as an ingredient, a declaration should be made using the words

“gelatin animal origin”. 

 A label should not contain any statement, claim, design, device, fancy name or 
abbreviation which is false or misleading in any particular way.

 The Act also makes it mandatory that labels should not use words implying 
recommendations by medical profession.

 The package, label or advertisements of edible oils and fats should not use 
expressions like ‘super- refined’, ‘extra- refined’, ‘double-refined’, ‘anti-cholesterol’, 
‘smoothening to heart’, etc.
 
 
COMPULSORY BEST BEFORE DATE 
 
Government has made it mandatory with effect from July 1999 that all packed food items 
should necessarily display BEST BEFORE DATE. 
 
It has been made mandatory that every container of milk substitute or infant food shall 
indicate in a clear conspicuous and easily readable manner an important notice which reads, 
‘MOTHER’S MILK IS BEST FOR BABIES’ in capitals. 
 
LABELLING GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
 
In Indian context in November 2000, the Ministry of Agriculture announced that genetically 
engineered seeds and food would not be allowed in the country until their safety was 
scientifically proved. 
 
MARKETING THE ‘ANIMAL ORIGIN’ FOOD 
 
From October 2001, it has become mandatory for all foods containing ingredients of animal 
origin to sport a brown dot encased in a brown box. As of now, milk and milk products if 
they are used as an ingredient are exempted from this order.

[WU1] 
As per "Dietary Guidelines for Indians, 2011" by National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), a 
balanced diet is one which provides all nutrients in required amounts and proper proportions. 
It should provide around 50-60% of total calories from carbohydrates, preferably from 
complex 
 
carbohydrates, about 10-15% from proteins and 20-30% from both visible and invisible fat. 
In 
 
addition, it should provide other non-nutrients such as dietary fibre, antioxidants, which 
bestow 
 
positive health benefits. 
 
The guidelines depict the importance of foods through a "Food Pyramid" (Figure 17.1). 
Balanced diet is recommended through a blend of four basic food groups such as cereals, 
millets and pulses; vegetables and fruits; oils, fats and nuts; milk and animal foods. Notably, 
food items such as burgers, pizzas, fries, chocolates, ice creams, jams etc. are not considered 
the right choice to meet nutrient needs and must be eaten sparingly.

HFSS Foods' and ingredients of concern 
 
As per WHO Document titled “Marketing of Foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar to Children – 
Update 2012-2013”, foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar are commonly termed as HFSS 
Foods. 
 
 
Sugar: Sugar is empty calories with no beneficial effect and there is no safe level of its 
intake. High use of sugar, particularly fructose, is harmful. Studies have established direct 
relationship 
 
of sugar with obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. 
 
Salt: Salt is added for preservation and enhancing the taste of food. High salt content in diet 
is strongly associated with high blood pressure and related cardiovascular diseases. Evidence 
suggests that high salt intake increases mass of left ventricle, stiffens and narrows arteries, 
including coronary and renal arteries. It increases the probability of stroke, severity of cardiac 
failure and tendency for platelets to aggregate. As per WHO, cutting down on dietary salt 
intake 
 
to recommended 5 g per day has a major impact on reducing blood pressure and 
 
cardiovascular 
 
diseases. 
 
Saturated Fatty Acid (SFA): SFAs are widely used in packaged foods including cookies, 
crackers, and snack chips. When consumed in excess of the recommended (limit less than 
10% of total calorie intake), SFAs are known to clog arteries and increase risk of heart attack 
and stroke. 
 
Trans Fatty Acid (TFA): TFAs are formed during the process of hydrogenation of vegetable 
oils (PHVOs) to make it semi solid that enables longer shelf life, better form and texture. 
Typically they are found to be high in bakery products and snacks that are deep-fried in 
PHVOs. 
 
TFAs are well known to have an adverse impact on blood lipid levels as they reduce the 
amount 
 
of good cholesterol (HDL) and increase bad cholesterol (LDL). Their consumption increases 
insulin resistance and promotes obesity. WHO recommends less than 1% of calories from 
TFAs. 
 
Besides the above key ingredients of concern, caffeine used in carbonated beverages and 
energy drinks is an addictive stimulant, which, if consumed in excess, can lead to impaired 
muscle and nerve functions, dehydration and a host of other disorders9. Consumption of 
caffeine, particularly among school children, is a matter of concern and needs to be strictly 
regulated in compliance with the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Regulations made 
there under. 
 
Unhealthy diet leads to metabolic changes and conditions such as overweight, high blood 
pressure, raised blood glucose and cholesterol, which are among the leading causes of NCD 
deaths in India. 
 
Childhood obesity 
 
Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. 
Overweight children are likely to become obese adults. As per WHO, about 44% of the 
diabetes 
 
burden and 23% of the CVD burden is attributable to overweight and obesity. Overweight 
children are more likely than non-overweight children to develop insulin resistance, 
hyperinsulinemia, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age, which in turn are 
associated with a higher chance of premature death and disability. 
 
 
Studies have established the link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous 
studies done among school children of Delhi, Amritsar, and Southern India show that the 
prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of 
Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent 
class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups. 
 
Hypertension 
 
In India, hypertension is the leading NCD risk and estimated to be attributable for over 10 per 
cent of all deaths. Hypertension is strongly associated with high Body Mass Index (BMI) and 
salt intake. As per WHO, the amount of dietary salt consumed is an important determinant of 
blood pressure levels and overall cardiovascular risk. World Heart Federation says that a 
universal reduction in dietary intake of about 3 gm. of salt, would lead to a 50% reduction in 
the number of people needing treatment for hypertension. The same decrease would lead to a 
22% drop in the number of deaths resulting from strokes and a 16% fall in the number of 
deaths from coronary heart disease. 
 
 
Diabetes and pediatric metabolic syndrome 
 
Type 2 diabetes which is very common in adults is now increasingly being reported in 
children. 
 
The leading risk factor for kids is being overweight, often connected with an unhealthy diet 
and lack of physical activity. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of the risk factors for type-2 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease characterized by abdominal obesity and others such as 
high blood pressure and increased plasma glucose. 
 
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) 
CHD affects Indians with greater frequency and at a younger age than counter parts 
 
HFSS food consumption in India 
 
Consumption of 'HFSS Food' is steeply increasing both in urban and rural areas. The ease of 
availability, taste, low cost, aggressive marketing and advertisements and peer pressure make 
them popular with children. 
 
HFSS food replacing balanced diet is a key issue: As per NIN dietary guidelines "the shift 
from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased intake intensive 
promotion of HFSS foods and beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as 
their dietary behavior. Irrational preference for energy-dense foods and those with high sugar 
and salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially children. The increasing 
number of overweight and obese people in the community and the resulting burden of 
chronic noncommunicable diseases necessitate systematic nutrition educational interventions 
on a massive scale." 
 
Additionally, a lot is at stake if balanced diet is replaced: A diverse range of 
macronutrients and micronutrients in its most natural form; Original flavors, colors and 
aroma that continue to 
 
keep the appetite alive for a lifetime; A wide range of time tested spices and herbs that 
continue 
 
to act at a prophylactic level (preventive) at sub-therapeutic levels. 
 
PREVENTIVE MEASURES 
 
Several countries have taken steps to enhance availability of wholesome and nutritious food 
to school children and to restrict/limit availability of HFSS Foods among them. With respect 
to India, the proposed guidelines are based on following principles: 
 
 
i) 
Children are not the best judge of their food choice. They have limited 
understanding on the impact of food on their health. Broadly, they are not aware 
about the concept of balanced diet and what kind of food is to be consumed and 
avoided to achieve it. They also lack required know-how on diseases and its relation 
to diet. While on one hand, they lack awareness and necessary discretion, such 
products are being promoted by manufacturers. They are one of the biggest viewer 
groups of television and food advertisements constitute a major share of overall TV, 
radio and print advertisements across the world. 
 
ii) 
Schools are not the right place for promoting HFSS foods. Schools are a place to 
learn right values and constructive behaviors for a lifetime. Since food consumption at 
school is significant part of the overall daily diet, schools should not allow the 
canteens to promote food habits that negatively impact the health of children. 
 
iii) 
Benefits of balanced, fresh and traditional food cannot be replaced. Frequent 
consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and fats and low in other essential macro and 
micronutrients is detrimental and should best be avoided. Such eating behaviors may 
extend beyond schools and become a dietary habit. 
 
iv) 
It is necessary to improve the dietary habits of school children by providing and 
appropriate mix of foods that enhances the wholesomeness and nutrition and also 
encourages them avoid consumption of unhealthy diet. 
 
v) 
Physical activity is another important element of promoting growth and help in 
reducing the risks and incidence of non-communicable diseases.

THE AUTHOR
INTRODUCTION
When I was about seven years old, I remember watching a talk show with
my grandmother and seeing this man with big muscles, who in my eyes
looked like a superhero. I recall being engrossed in every word that came
out of his mouth and listening to how he used to do hundreds of push-ups in
his small bedroom in Austria when he was nine or ten. I remember running
to my room to do as many push-ups as I could – which turned out to be
maybe one, possibly two! But I went to bed that night dreaming that
someday, I would be big, strong and muscular like the man on TV. That
man went on to become one of the top grossing movie stars of all time and
the Governor of California. His name – Arnold Schwarzenegger. That night,
the seed of my love for fitness was sown.
I was born into a massive sporting family and grew up on a small farm in
Connemara in the West of Ireland.
I wasn’t very scholarly at school: from the age of six to 17 or 18, my entire
life circulated around playing sports, especially Gaelic Football, Ireland’s
national sport, which was my personal favourite.
My closest friends like to joke with me that I’m the living embodiment of,
‘If it isn’t a priority, it doesn’t get done’ and there’s a lot of truth to this.
From an academic stand point I just about got through school, but from a
sports standpoint, I made it into every team I tried out for, spending hours
every evening practising skills and drills to improve my performance. To
master my football techniques, I would learn to kick equally well with both
feet, would hang car tyres in front of my home-made goals and try to kick
the ball through them. I wouldn’t enter the house until I passed the ball
through the tyre 10 times in a row. I did everything to improve my game.
My schoolbag was a glorified doorstopper for most of my teens.
School was never really a focus for me, so I never excelled until my early
twenties. I regularly had teachers tell me I was going to be on welfare for
life unless I turned professional in one of the sports I played.
I remember one time when I was picked up by the ear and kicked out of the
class for mapping out my workout routine during the time allotted to some
other task. I recall walking down the long narrow corridor to the principal’s
office with my heart in my mouth. It was the third or fourth time I had been
sent that week. I’ll never forget the conversation we had that day.
My principal, also named Brian, sat me down and told me that although I
obviously should be doing the allocated tasks and not calculating my 10 rep
max during class, I was going to be fine in life. He had seen my work ethic
and dedication to football and talked about my ability to lead others on the
pitch. He said that I had the personality to do big things with my life and
never to let other teachers’ opinions of me change who I am at the core. I
don’t remember much of the conversation, but I can never forget the feeling
I had when I left that office. ‘People will forget what you said, people will
forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel’
(Maya Angelou), and I think even at a subconscious level, that’s where my
‘just do you’ life philosophy comes from. That was the first time I had an
authority figure, besides my mum, tell me that I was going to do something
with my life, and I’ll be forever grateful for the belief that conversation
instilled in me. It is rightly said that great teachers can inspire you to do
great things.
I’ve since gone to university, received an honours degree in Business,
completed post-graduation in teaching, won an All-Ireland medal with my
club, travelled the world as a professional fitness model and run my own
business that works with and serves thousands of people every year.
This book is a culmination of everything I have learnt over the last 17 years
of training and nearly 30 years of life. The book is split into two sections.
The first half contains everything about fitness and health: nutrition,
training, supplements, sleep, alcohol and hydration. These are the essentials
you need to get into incredible shape, increase your energy and reap the
results of understanding how your body works. I nearly quit fitness several
times during my early twenties from sheer information overload. There was
so much conflicting material out there that I didn’t know what to believe,
what to try or what worked. I’ve used my personal 17 years of training and
nutrition knowledge to try and find a shortcut for your journey. I effectively
wrote all this for the 22-year-old me who nearly quit a hundred times.
The second half is focused on cultivating the mind-set to get great results,
using step-by-step strategies to help you implement them. It discusses
everything from creating habits, setting goals and reducing stress to
maximise your energy levels, to my own personal stories of dealing with
stress, anxiety and worry in my own life.
The last section is entitled ‘Practical life tips’ and is written for my
daughter. None of us truly knows how much time we have on this planet
and the life tips are a culmination of personal philosophies that I want to
pass on to my daughter in case anything ever happens to me.
HOW TO READ THIS BOOK
Personally, I love being able to flip through books and pick out the most
relevant sections for me so I’ve written this book with that in mind. I have
also woven in personal stories to give context to theoretical ideas. If fitness
is your primary goal and you are just looking for a blueprint to get into
incredible shape, I would definitely recommend starting with Section One.
If you are looking for some practical life tips and how to deal with anxiety,
stress, worry or any of life’s regular problems, I would advise jumping
straight to the second section, Mind-set.
However, if you are looking to get in great shape, have more energy, feel
better and happier in all aspects of your life and nurture the mind-set to
maintain it, then I would read the book in its entirety. Thank you for
reading, and I hope this book serves you incredibly well on your journey.

CHAPTER 1
NUTRITION
This chapter is designed to give you an improved understanding of how
nutrition plays a vital role in giving your body energy, helping it use fat as a
fuel source and aiding in building lean muscle. This section discusses
everything from calories and macronutrients to the specific role of each in
changing your body composition and improving energy levels. We will start
with the foundation principles such as ‘what is a calorie;’ and ‘what are
macro nutrients’ and other ideas that are imperative to understand in order
to change your body composition and improve your energy levels.
We will explore the detailed ways in which certain foods affect the body in
a positive and negative way (in the context of body composition, fat loss
and energy levels) and also investigate the roles of three macro nutrients:
protein, carbohydrates and fat in more detail.
NEVER BUILD YOUR HOUSE ON SAND
Personally, I’m not very religious, but I do love the messages from some of
the great books of times past, The Bible, The Torah and the Quran to name
a few. One of my favourite passages in The Bible is from the parable of the
wise and the foolish builders in Matthew 7:26, which I paraphrase: ‘It’s a
foolish man who builds his house on sand.’
Nutrition is exactly the same. Once you have the fundamentals and a solid
foundation for nutrition, it’s easy to build on top of that. There are so many
different nutritional strategies you can follow: clean eating, keto, IIFYM,
Paleo, 80:20, to name just a few, but the key is to get the foundations in
place first. I will not offer an opinion regarding which strategy is the best.
They all work in their own way and learning which system fits into your
lifestyle is always going to be the key. I will, though, recommend the
foundation principles that I think every nutritional strategy should have and
then you can adopt different systems based on these principles.
Before we dig deeper, it’s important that you understand the fundamentals.
All great ideas are built on solid foundations, and calories and
macronutrients are the foundations of every good nutritional strategy.
WHAT IS A CALORIE?
A calorie (or a kilocalorie) is a unit of energy. Human beings require energy
to survive – to breathe, move, pump blood, etc., and we acquire this energy
from food.
The number of calories in a food item is a measure of how much potential
energy that food possesses.
For example:
1g of carbohydrates has 4 calories
1g of protein has 4 calories
1g of fat has 9 calories
Various foods are a compilation of these three building blocks. Therefore, if
you know how many carbohydrates, fats and proteins are present in any
given food item, you can calculate how many calories or how much energy
that food contains. Below is an example of the formula for calculating the
number of calories in a food.
For example:
100g of oats (generic brand)
This is a low-fat, high-carb, low-to-moderate-protein food. Protein: 16.5g
(16.5g × 4 kcal),
Carbohydrates: 66g (66g × 4 kcal),
Fat: 7g (7 g × 9 kcal),
Total calories: 393 kcal.
Note: The same formula can be applied to any food item to calculate the
number of calories.
HOW MANY CALORIES DO YOU NEED?
This number can vary greatly from person to person. From the nutritional
labels of the foods you buy, you may notice that the ‘percent daily values’
are based on a 2,000 or 2,500 calorie diet.
According to the National Health Service (NHS), 2,500 (for males) or 2,000
(for females) calories is a rough average of how much a semi-active adult
needs to eat in a day. However, your body might need more or less than the
recommended number of calories in order to achieve the physique you’re
striving for. Height, weight, gender, age and activity level, all affect your
caloric needs.
In addition, at the most basic level, if you eat more calories than you burn,
you will add weight. On the flip side, if you eat fewer calories than you
burn, you will lose weight. This is true at the most basic level, but there are
a number of other factors that come into play.
1. The digestion of each food – One of my mentors would always say to me,
‘it’s not about what you eat, it’s about what you absorb’. The truth is, it’s a
combination of both. Your food choices are important, but you also need to
consider how much of that food you are absorbing. Will 100g of rice from a
microwave packet filled with preservatives be absorbed the same way as 100 g of
pure rice that needs to be boiled and drained? The answer is ‘no.’ The removal of
some fibre and the addition of preservatives, means that microwavable ready-made
foods will have a significantly lower absorption rate than their non-processed
alternatives, thus leaving you with less energy for the same number of calories.
Further in this chapter, I will discuss how making one simple change – eliminating
or greatly reducing processed foods – can have an incredibly beneficial impact on
your body’s ability to burn body fat or build lean muscle. With this change, you
will also experience an extremely noticeable effect in your energy – even after
merely a few days.
2. Keeping the blood sugar levels stable – As mentioned above, once
you hit your daily calorie or macronutrient (macro) targets, in theory, you will lose
or gain weight. However, as much as I wish it were as simple as that, your body
doesn’t work as one plus one equals two. In my experience, keeping your blood
sugars levels stable is one of the most important factors in any nutritional plan. If
your blood sugar levels are not balanced, you are going to suffer from low energy
levels, mood swings and a general ‘high/low’ that comes with sugar spikes and
crashes. Later in the chapter, I will discuss how balancing blood sugar levels can
completely eliminate cravings, improve energy levels and increase your body’s
ability to burn fat or build lean muscle.
In terms of just losing weight, it can be as simple as eating fewer calories
than you burn. If you want to lose weight quickly and you don’t care about
body composition, muscle tone, energy levels or keeping the weight off
over the long term, then by all means you can stop reading right away.
However, if you want to know how to eat more real food, increase your
energy levels, have a leaner, more toned or muscular physique AND keep it
for the long term, then keep reading.
There’s one more fundamental that needs to be understood before we
continue: macronutrients.
What are macronutrients?
Definition: ‘A type of food (e.g. fat, protein, carbohydrate) required in large
amounts in the diet.’ – Webster Dictionary.
Macronutrients are nutrients that provide calories or energy. Nutrients are
the substances required for growth, metabolism and for other body
functions. Since ‘macro’ means large, macronutrients are the nutrients
required in large amounts.
There are three primary macronutrients:
Proteins
Fats
Carbohydrates
PROTEINS
Proteins are made of varying combinations of amino acids, 20 in all. Amino
acids make up every tissue and substance in our bodies, from hair and heart
to hormones. Depending on your goals, in order to build a leaner or more
muscular body, we need the right combination of amino acids interacting
with fundamentally healthy cells in order to repair and build tissues for lean
muscle.
Carbohydrates and fats are important, but nothing compares to the ability of
amino acids to grow, repair and maintain a healthy tissue.
There are eight essential amino acids for adults (valine, isoleucine, leucine,
phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, and lysine) and nine for
children (add histidine to the list). The body can make all the other amino
acids from the essential ones, but we must get the essential ones from the
foods or supplements we consume. This is why it’s so important to
supplement with leuicine, isoleuicine and valine (Branch Chain Amino
Acids) when trying to build lean muscle, as your body can’t produce them
by itself.
Animal and fish protein contains all the essential amino acids in proper
proportions to one another – a characteristic of all flesh foods – and thus is
known as complete protein. You can also get essential amino acids in the
plant kingdom. They are just not in their complete protein proportions, and
therefore, you have to mix and match them to make them complete
proteins. Because most plants provide inadequate amounts of certain amino
acids in relation to others, plant protein is normally referred to as
‘incomplete’ protein.
Why do we need protein?
Growth: especially when looking to build lean muscle tissue.
Tissue repair: to repair muscle tissue after intensive workouts.
Immune function: to avoid getting sick.
To get energy when carbohydrate is not available: This is by gluconeogenesis,
whereby your body converts protein to glucose for energy.
To preserve lean muscle mass: to retain the muscle you already have.
How do I get my protein if I don’t eat meat?
It’s true that meat and eggs are complete proteins, in contrast to beans and
nuts. However, we don’t need every essential amino acid from every meal
we eat – we only need a sufficient amount of each amino acid each day.
During the digestive process, our bodies free the amino acids present in our
food and create other substances from them. According to the Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention, if something we eat doesn’t contain all the
essential amino acids required by the body, we have a small window (about
a day) to ingest the complementary ones to complete the amino-acid
equation.
The body doesn’t house or store amino acids (i.e. you need to eat them
every day), but as long as you eat the correct food combinations during the
day, you will be fine. As mentioned above, you don’t necessarily have to
combine them in one meal. You just need to make sure that you combine
the right foods to get all the essential amino acids in the right amounts by
the end of the day. There are numerous ways to use food combinations to
get all your essential amino acids. I’ll list a few examples below.
Combining nuts and seeds with legumes or grains
Combining legumes with sunflower seeds, sesame seeds or nuts such as
walnuts, almonds or cashew provides complete proteins. One of my
personal favourites is a trail mix of nuts, cashews, sunflower seeds with
hummus or guacamole dip and raw vegetables.
To cement the idea that you do not need to consume protein-rich food
together in a single meal to reap the benefits of combining proteins, The
University of Michigan’s reports show that, ‘Eating a variety of foods with
incomplete proteins throughout the day allows your body to get the amino
acids you need from diet.’ The one thing to remember is that your body
doesn’t store complete proteins for a rainy day. According to the Standing
Committee on the Scientific Evaluation for Dietary Reference Intakes,
‘There is no evidence for a protein reserve that serves only as a store to
meet future needs’, which means you need to stay on top of your nutrition
and combine your foods every single day to reap all the benefit of essential
amino acids. However, once you use the correct nutritional strategy that
includes all the essential amino acids, you can get all the benefits of a
complete protein eater, so long as you are resourceful with your
combinations.
The benefits of animal products
The truth is, it’s significantly easier to get all your essential amino acids
from meat, fish and eggs, which are already loaded with them all. While
steak contains protein, it also contains fat, vitamins A, B, iron and zinc.
However, not all meat and fish are created equally. Different animal
proteins have different nutritional densities. The differences between a
grass-fed cow or a free-range chicken and an antibiotic-pumped cow and
factory chicken are tremendous.
Avoid factory-farmed meat and fish
The most nutrient-rich proteins are from properly raised meat. Personally,
I’m a massive fan of poultry, but the hormone-loaded chickens that are
found in some commercial supermarkets are best avoided. If you can get
your hands on organic and/or free-range chicken (just ask your local
butcher), you are going to get a much higher nutritional return.
In case of fish, try to avoid farmed fish that has been pumped full of
colourings, and opt for wild fish whenever possible. Again, your
supermarket or local fishmonger should be able to tell you which fish is
wild and which has been farmed. There’s a frustrating paradox for those
who eat farmed fish for their health, as the nutritional benefits of farmed
fish are greatly decreased.
Take omega 3 fatty acids. Wild fish get their omega 3 from aquatic plants.
Farmed fish, however, are often fed corn, soy or other feed stuff that have
little or no omega 3s. The unnatural, high-corn diet also means that some
farmed fish accumulate unhealthy levels of the wrong fatty acids. The most
concerning issue is that farmed fish are routinely dosed with antibiotics,
which can then enter your body and cause all kinds of harm, not to mention
slowing down any physical progress, such as losing fat, building muscle,
etc. Remember the famous quote, ‘You are what you eat’? You can
probably extend this to, ‘You are also what your food eats.’
Eat the right meat and get more vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that keeps your nerves and blood
cells healthy. It is responsible for the smooth functioning of several critical
body processes. It is pretty easy to develop a vitamin B12 deficiency, the
first symptom normally being chronic fatigue.
Strict vegetarians or vegans, heavy drinkers and smokers are usually most
susceptible to vitamin B12 deficiency.
B12 is found only in animal products, yet even lactoovo vegetarians (those
who drink milk and eat eggs) may miss out on it. Sometimes what matters
the most isn’t whether a nutrient is found within a food, but whether the
body can actually absorb it and use it properly. According to the report in
the Journal of Experimental Biology and Medicine, the bioavailability (how
much you absorb) of vitamin B12 from eggs is less than 9%, which means
that from all the B12 found in eggs, the body absorbs only 9%. Compare
this to red meat for example, which has a bioavailability as high as 77%.
That’s not to say that eggs are not incredibly nutritious because they are, the
yolks in particular, but B12 isn’t their strong suit.
If you are a vegetarian, vegan, smoker or drinker, you should seriously
consider adding B12 to your supplement regimen. Personally, I use vitamin
B12 spray every single day for the regulation of my nervous system, which
can also reduce stress, worry and anxiety. However, there are numerous
other benefits to adding B12 to your supplement regimen if you are not
consuming it from food.
It is required to convert carbohydrates into glucose in the body, thus leading to
energy production and a decrease in fatigue and lethargy in the body. Basically, it
massively reduces your risk of chronic fatigue.
It helps maintain a healthy digestive system. Remember, it’s more about what you
absorb than what you eat.
It is essential for healthy skin, hair and nails and can help in cell reproduction and
constant renewal of the skin.
It has been thought to help prevent breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer through
regulation of the nervous system.
Our body can store and recycle B12, an evolutionary adaption that makes
sense, as B12 is so necessary that our bodies have evolved the capacity to
store it for survival in times of scarcity. However, there’s a downside to
being able to store and recycle it: the symptoms of long-term inadequate
intake can take years to show themselves. Long-term deficiency puts you at
a risk of nerve degeneration, mental disturbance and depression amongst a
host of other problems.
Once these symptoms manifest, it’s nearly impossible to fully recover. The
take-home message is to make sure that you get enough vitamin B12 from
your meat or consider adding it to your supplement regimen. Personally, I
only eat red meat once or twice a week, so I hedge my bets and supplement
with it.

How to choose your eggs
The old adage, ‘You are what you eat’ certainly holds true when
considering the nutritional value of eggs. For chicken to be classified as
‘free range’, it must have been granted access to the outdoors during the
raising process. Hens that have access to better pasture have better eggs
than birds kept in cages.
Free-range hens eat a healthy, natural diet that then manifests into healthier
and more nutritious eggs. Alongside having more vitamin A and vitamin E,
the main benefit of free-range eggs is their omega 3 fatty acid value.
As mentioned in the fat section of the book, omega 3s are an essential fatty
acid because the body can’t manufacture it on its own, and you must
consume it from food. According to Barb Gorski from Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education, free-range hens normally produce four
times the omega 3s as their caged sisters. The egg yolk, which has most of
the nutritional value, is the best indicator of egg quality. A darker yolk,
normally dark orange, is an indication of a chicken fed with nutritious and
balanced diet rich in omega 3, while a bright yellow yolk is normally the
result of caged, poorly fed chickens.
Free-range organic chicken farmers must feed their chickens lots of fresh
greens including kale, collard and broccoli to produce the dark orange yolk,
which has been proven to not only taste richer but also being richer in
nutrients and vitamins.
The take-home message is to always buy free-range organic eggs, which are
slightly more expensive, but pack a much higher nutritional punch and can
actually help you get leaner, faster, due to their higher omega 3 levels.
What are the best sources of protein?
Personally, I prefer meat and fish sources, as they already have all the
essential amino acids that your body requires, but even if you don’t eat
meat, you can get all your essential amino acids by combining the right
foods. It just means you have to get a bit more experimental with your
recipes.
I’ll list my favourites below. Personally, I try and source all my meat and
fish from local butchers and fishmongers, as they can tell me if they have
used any antibiotics, hormones or additives. However, most supermarkets
also have organic, free-range or grass-fed sections. Again, they may cost a
little bit more (but not in all cases – my local butcher is actually cheaper
than most supermarkets) so shop around and find what works the best for
you.
Some foods such as beef and salmon also have a high-fat content, but are
primarily protein foods, which is why I have included them in this list.
Chicken (free range if possible)
Turkey (free range if possible)
Free-range eggs
Beef or lamb (grass fed if possible)
Rice protein powder
Whey protein powder
Wild fish (salmon, cod, mackerel, etc.)
FAT
Thankfully, over the past two decades, we have begun to move away from
the ‘Fat is bad for you’ or ‘Fat will make you fat’ mindset, which has
negatively affected so many people’s lives, energy levels and waistlines.
With the massive influx of processed foods and refined cereals over the past
decade, unless you are actually going out of your way to consume good
healthy fat, you’re very likely to be undereating it.
Why do we need fat?
For brain function: Omega 3, for example, plays a critical role in brain function.
To burn body fat: Certain types of fats such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)
found in grass-fed cows and pasteurised butter can actually help your body burn
fat.
For steady energy: Fat is the most concentrated source of energy. It can give you
steady energy throughout the day and keep your blood sugar levels stable.
To absorb certain vitamins: Vitamins A, D, E, K and carotenoids are all fat soluble,
i.e. you need to consume them with fat for their absorption.
Protection: Actual body fat can provide cushioning for the organs.
Eating the right kind of fat is absolutely vital for optimal health.
Dietary fats for repair and growth
Fatty acids have a profound effect on muscle gain, fat loss and overall
health. Fat is the building block of all cell membranes. It is also the
precursor for all natural steroid hormones and some neurotransmitters (a
‘precursor’ is a substance from which another substance is formed, similar
to putting all the ingredients for a cake into the oven in order to make the
actual cake.)
Most importantly, certain fatty acids can generate a hormone-like effect on
the body, regulating hunger, fat loss and muscle-building hormones. This is
the primary reason why some modern-day diets can completely ruin your
metabolism. Modern breakfast cereals and cereal bars for example are so
highly processed, high in sugar and devoid of absorbable nutrients that they
leave you fighting a losing blood sugar battle for the rest of the day. The
answer is to eat more fat.
Define fat
When we talk about fat types – saturated, monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated – we’re actually talking about fatty acids. Fatty acids are
chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms attached to a carboxyl group (think of
it like a hinge on your bike that keeps individual chain links together.)
Every fat, whether plant or animal, is made up of these same raw materials.
In saturated fat, every link in the fatty acid chain is secured – it’s saturated.
Monounsaturated fats have just one unsecured link (mono is Latin for
‘one’), and polyunsaturated fats have two or more unsecured links in their
chains (poly is Latin for ‘many’).
In truth, almost all the natural fats we eat are a blend of these three kinds of
fat, but whatever a fat is mostly made of, whether saturated,
monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat, is generally what we call it. We do
the same with macronutrients. Oats, for example, have a little fat and some
protein, but are primarily comprised of carbohydrates, which is why we
label them as a ‘carbohydrate’ food.
Avoid margarines and eat egg yolks and real butter
Saturated fat was demonized during the early 90’s because we thought it
raised cholesterol, and we linked high cholesterol to heart disease.
The heart disease epidemic is a relatively new problem in human history,
and according to the author of Eat the Yolks, Liz Wolfe, ‘The first recorded
heart attack was in 1912 and by 1930 the number of heart attacks had
reached 3,000 and by 1960, there were over 500,000 deaths recorded from
heart attacks.’
People were terrified and needed an explanation, and a bad guy. In stepped
saturated fat. The western culture’s panic led to the development of two
ideas that became interlinked: saturated fat is bad, and saturated fat raises
cholesterol levels, which gives you a heart attack. This is where margarines
and vegetable oil came in to save the day.
According to Chris Masterjob, an expert in nutrition science, randomised
controlled trials have shown that polyunsaturated fats can’t reduce heart
diseases. In fact, no study on replacing animal fat (saturated fat) with plant-
based polyunsaturated fat has shown to reduce mortality. More
interestingly, Masterjob stated that these studies showed ‘An increased risk
of cancer after five years and possible increase in heart disease risk’.
Are these heart-healthy vegetable oils therefore bad for us? I’ll let you
make your own decision regarding this, but if fat loss, muscle building or
increasing energy is your goal, margarines and other vegetable oils are very
unlikely to support you on your journey. It’s also worth noting that the
vegetable oils are made up of corn, soya and canola. Corn is a grain, not a
vegetable. Soybeans are legumes, not vegetables. Canola is derived from a
seed, not a vegetable.
As mentioned earlier, in the case of eggs, the nutritional density of the egg
yolk of a free-range chicken to that of her sister raised in a cage or a factory
is also worlds apart.
Considering that margarine is generally a blend of crops oils and usually
includes additives like emulsifiers, and that butter from pastured cows
actually contains fat-burning ingredients like CLA (which is present in most
fat-burning supplements), it’s probably better to stick to the real thing.
Kerrygold Irish butter for example is produced from pastured cows.
The key with fat is to make sure you don’t eat too much, as it is calorie
dense (i.e. you don’t need to eat a lot to get a lot of calories), but factoring it
into your nutritional plan can make you feel more satiated, give you more
energy and can actually speed up fat loss in conjunction with the right
training program and overall nutritional plan.
But what about calories?
Having an idea of calorie consumption is important for your fitness goals. If
you want to lose weight and your calorie maintenance, which is the number
of calories you need to eat to stay the same weight, is 2,000 kcal, and you
eat 6,000 kcal every day, you will probably not lose weight or body fat too
quickly. On the other hand, if you are trying to build muscle and your
maintenance is 2,000 kcal, you need to eat significantly more in order to
build lean muscle. However, the amount is obviously dependent on the
speed of your metabolism, current body fat levels, general lifestyle,
amongst other factors.
Fat has more calories per gram (9 kcal) than either carbs or protein (both 4
kcal). However, the reality is that 500 kcal from fat is absorbed much
differently than 500 kcal from carbohydrates. Fat is more satiating, meaning
it will leave you feeling fuller for longer, and including good quality fats
that help stabilize blood sugar and hunger levels can be the key to losing
body fat, building more muscle and giving you steady energy throughout
the day.
Eat fat, lose fat
The take-home message is pretty simple. Eat real food. Our bodies and
digestive systems are designed to eat food as near to its natural state as
possible, and not the low-fat versions. Therefore, eat properly raised
animals, minimally processed animal products and wild fish, and as long as
you have calculated the amount of calories you are eating, don’t fear the fat
that comes with them.
Not all fat is created equal
One of the biggest misconceptions that I fell victim to in my early twenties
was that, ‘Eating fat will make you fat’. I think a more accurate rephrasing
would be, ‘Certain fat will make you fat’. The three main types of fat that
are important to understand are omega 6, omega 3 and trans fatty acids.
Omega 3 and omega 6
Both essential fatty acids (EFA), omega 3 and omega 6 are considered vital
and beneficial. However, omega 3 EFA is normally considered slightly
more important, as the modern western diet is likely to be more deficient in
omega 3 than omega 6. This is because the king of the omega 3 family,
alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and his metabolically active prince and
princess, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),
are more unsaturated and prone to damage in cooking and food processing.
In other sections of the book, I’ve spoken how food processing removes a
lot of nutrients from food, and omega 3 is a primary example.
Why do I need omega 3?
Omega 3 is actively involved in critical biological functions such as
improving cognitive abilities, helping you retain information better, helping
you perform complicated tasks more effectively, alleviating pain and
inflammation, and improving insulin sensitivity.
If you find that you have brain fog, pain from inflammation or have body
fat to lose, it might be worth increasing your omega 3 intake.
The best sources of omega 3
The best seed oils for omega 3 are flax (also known as linseed), hemp and
pumpkin. For example, one of my favourite health shakes includes a
mixture of rice or whey protein, flaxseed oil, hempseeds and pumpkin
seeds.
If you eat carnivorous fish such as mackerel, herring, tuna and salmon, or
their oils, you can bypass the conversion stage of alpha linoleic acid and go
straight to EPA and DHA. This is why fish-eating cultures (the Japanese
culture for example) have three times the omega 3 than their western
counterparts. Vegans who eat more seeds tend to have much higher levels of
omega 3 as well.
What are the best sources of fat?
Oily fish (salmon, mackerel)
Nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews)
Seeds (pumpkin, linseed, chia)
Oils (flaxseed, hemp)
Avoid this type of fat or you will get fat
Trans-fatty acids or ‘trans fats’ definition:
‘An unsaturated fatty acid of a type occurring in 
margarines and manufactured cooking oils as a result 
of the hydrogenations process. Consumption 
of such acids is thought to increase the risk 
of atherosclerosis (a disease of the arteries).’
WEBSTER DICTIONARY
Trans fats are created as a result of the partial hydrogenation process, or as
Liz Wolfe describes it, ‘The process of beating an already unhealthy oil into
partially hydrogenated submission’. This basically means they change
already unhealthy oils into something even worse! Not only have trans fats
been shown to lead to a range of health problems (heart disease, obesity
etc.), but they are also the single worst types of fats if you are trying to
reduce your own levels of body fat. Your body can store them pretty easily.
To understand how bad trans fats truly are, here’s a brief explanation at its
simplest form of how your body actually taps into fat stores, burning
through unwanted body fat in the process.
There are obviously digestive, metabolic and hormonal processes that affect
this, but at the most basic level your body’s preferred source of energy is
glucose (all carbohydrates you consume get converted to glucose). To
simplify, any excess glucose gets stored as glycogen (stored carbohydrate),
and then any excess glucose gets stored as body fat (fat stores). Following
is the energy chain.
Now, add trans fats into the mix and observe how the energy chain changes.
You have now added another figurative ‘wall’ to jump over in your quest to
lose body fat. Personally, when I used to eat fast food, hydrogenated oils
and other trans fatty acids, it normally increased body fat around my
‘stubborn areas’ (i.e. places you struggle to remove fat from) such as my
lower abdomen and glute region.
‘Trans’ is Latin for the opposite side, and hence the name trans fat. Your
body doesn’t recognise trans fats – their actual chemical makeup is
completely foreign to it. Because of this, as soon as you consume them,
your body panics and tends to shuttle them straight into the fat pockets or
visceral fat (fat over the organs), so as not to damage your vital organs.
This is basically a survival safety mechanism: your vital organs are safe if
the ‘unknown’ consumption – trans fats in this case – are safely tucked
away in your fat pockets. The easiest way to avoid trans fats is to reduce or
eliminate deep fat fried or fast food alongside certain margarines. Not only
will you get a substantial increase in energy levels, but your process of
reducing unwanted body fat will also significantly speed up.
CARBOHYDRATES
The human body is designed to run on carbohydrates. While we can use
protein and fat for energy, the easiest fuels for our body to use are
carbohydrates.
When we eat complex carbohydrates like wholegrains, vegetables, beans
and lentils, or simpler carbohydrates like fruit, the body does exactly what it
is designed to do: it breaks them down and gives us energy. Even better, as
these foods haven’t been modified or processed, all the nutrients that the
body needs for digestion and metabolism are already present in them. They
also contain fibre, which is a less digestible type of carbohydrate that helps
the digestive system run smoothly.
Carbohydrates have developed a pretty bad reputation over recent years, but
when used correctly, they can be massively beneficial in keeping blood
sugar stable and energy levels constant and fuelling your body for
workouts.
Remember, carbohydrates have one job – to give you energy. There is no
‘essential carbohydrate’ like essential amino acids from protein or essential
fatty acids from fat: they exist to give your body and brain energy. Keeping
this in mind, their correct use can be a great weapon in your arsenal. I like
to think of carbohydrates like a guard dog – if you treat them well
throughout their life, they will look after you, make you feel better and help
you sleep better at night. If you abuse them though, they can turn around
and bite you just as fast.
Why do we need carbohydrates?
As mentioned above, we don’t ‘need’ carbohydrates. However, if you are a
highly active individual, carbohydrates will definitely have some great
benefits for your body.
Body’s main source of fuel: glucose and glycogen.
Easily used by the body for energy: fuelling intensive workouts.
Used by all tissues and cells for energy: glucose.
Can be stored in the muscles and liver and later used for energy.
Note: This is great for fitness-seeking people for whom performance is key, but
overdoing it can also lead to fat gain.
Good source of fibre: certain types of carbohydrates that our body can’t digest are
passed through the intestinal tract intact and help to move waste out of the body.
Are fruits good or bad?
Unlike vegetables, particularly green leafy vegetables, which are nearly
impossible to overeat, the answers regarding the effect of fruit on body
composition can vary depending on who you speak with. I have heard every
argument from ‘Fruit will make you fat’ to ‘We’re evolved to eat fruit,
which should be a staple part of every diet on the planet!’. There are a few
topics, which I can argue just as strongly on both sides.
On one hand, I am a massive fan of the vitamins and minerals that fruits
naturally contain. In addition, if timed right, they can balance blood sugar
and enormously curb a natural sweet tooth. On the other hand, fructose is
converted to glucose pretty easily and excess of it can lead to unnecessary
fat gain. Further, there are certain fruits that are nearly pure glucose and can
hugely elevate blood sugar levels, leading to a whole host of energy crashes
and fat-gain problems. The truth isn’t whether fruits are inherently good or
bad; it’s the selection choices you make and their timings that are key.
Fruits contain a simple sugar called fructose, which needs no digestion and
can therefore enter the bloodstream quickly, like glucose or sucrose.
However, unlike them, fructose is classified as slow releasing because the
body can’t use it as it is and has to convert it into glucose before your body
can effectively use it. This slows down the sugar’s effect on the
metabolism.
Some fruits such as grapes, mangoes and dates contain pure glucose and are
therefore faster releasing. Bananas contain both fructose and glucose and
thereby raise blood sugar levels quite speedily and are thus worth watching
out for too.
Through personal experience, the negatives of raising blood sugar
dramatically, even post workout, massively outweighs the benefits. It feels
as if you are spending the rest of the day trying to stabilise your energy
levels as your blood sugars balance. I would use these fruits in moderation
to avoid an imbalance in blood sugars, which can slow down the fat-
burning process and lead to unnecessary energy drops during the day.
Avoid refined carbohydrates
Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, white rice or refined cereals
have a similar effect to refined sugar. When you eat simple carbohydrates,
you get a rapid increase in blood sugar level and a corresponding surge in
energy. A drop however follows the surge, as the body scrambles to balance
your blood sugar levels. This drop, especially if it happens frequently
through the day, can give you a whole host of problems, right from short-
term problems like irritability, tiredness and headaches to long-term
problems like fatigue and weight gain. This is where balancing your blood
sugar levels becomes the key.
Balancing blood sugars
Keeping blood sugar balanced is probably the most important factor in
maintaining steady energy levels and weight. The level of glucose in your
blood largely determines your appetite. When the level of glucose drops,
you feel hungry. The glucose in your bloodstream is available for your cells
to produce energy. When the levels are too high, the body converts the
excess to glycogen or fat, our long-term energy reserves. If our blood sugar
levels are too low, we experience a host of symptoms including fatigue,
poor concentration, irritability, depression, headaches and digestive
problems. So how do we keep our blood sugars balanced?
Four tips to keep blood sugar levels balanced
1. Eat something small every three hours: A great breakdown is to have
your three main meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner, with two or three snacks in
between. Keeping your energy and blood sugar levels stable and in balance can
allow you to train harder without getting food cravings associated with blood sugar
drops, which can come from missing meals and snacks. This can give you a
significantly better quality of life by increasing your overall energy levels, as a
result helping you lose body fat and/or building lean muscle in the process.
2. Avoid processed food and eat more vegetables: Processed food
actually has two major negative effects on your body. Firstly, ingredients and
nutrients from the original source are removed to produce most processed foods
and replaced with sugar for preservation. Blood sugars dramatically rise with
consumption of these types of food.
Secondly, the ‘energy surge/drop feedback loop’ (loads of energy followed by a
crash) that refined sugar creates, can have a highly negative effect on your blood
sugar levels. If blood sugar levels are out of balance, your entire body will be less
efficient at converting carbohydrate for energy. Some can get a mild to severe form
of insulin resistance leading to a lack of nutrient uptake for healthy nerve and
muscle cells, which can have a detrimental impact on any fat loss and/or muscle
building goals.
Vegetables, on top of being very low in calories, are also packed with vitamins,
minerals and fibre. I would recommend adding some vegetables or salad to your
main meals or eat them as snacks throughout the day.
3. Eat more fat: As discussed at length in the fat section above, having a higher
level of fat particularly healthy fat like omega 3 from oily fish can do a tremendous
job at balancing blood sugar levels. The truth is, if you only eat a diet with good,
hormone-boosting fats, nutrient-dense vegetables and quality-protein sources,
because fat is satiating and slow releasing, it is unlikely that you would ever have a
blood sugar issue. For the majority of people, including myself, this isn’t feasible
and the key, therefore, is to choose the correct sources of carbohydrate, timing
them right and making them work for you.
4. Eat slow-releasing carbohydrates at insulin-sensitive times:
There are two times in the day (morning and post workout) when you will be
particularly insulin sensitive because your body will be more likely to use
carbohydrates efficiently and not store them as fat. This varies according to your
metabolism but in general, your body will absorb and uptake carbohydrates more
efficiently first thing in the morning, after a fasted sleep and post workout, after
you have trained.
If you have ever thought to yourself, ‘Carbs will make me fat’ I will try to
crush that myth now. It is true that excess carbohydrates, especially refined
sugars and processed carbohydrates, can get transported by the liver and get
converted to body fat. However, if you follow a good training program,
using short bursts of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for your cardio
and are consuming calories in alignment with your goals, the consumption
of good-quality carbohydrates is highly unlikely to increase your body fat.
What are the best sources of carbohydrates?
Oats
Sweet potato
Baby new potatoes
Brown or basmati rice
Vegetables
Fruit (used in alignment with your goals)
As mentioned above, the key is timing your meals to keep your blood sugar
levels stable and then using quality food to keep your body fuelled. Here is
a sample daily layout, but you can use your own favourite foods to make it
suit your lifestyle.

SUPPLEMENTS
Supplement definition:
‘A thing added to something else in order 
to complete or enhance it.’
WEBSTER DICTIONARY
Supplements make it much easier to get the necessary nutrients to build
muscle and lose body fat, and they can give you an advantage and enhance
your training when taken the right way, combined with a good diet.
However, using supplements without a good diet is like using amazing
motor oil for your car, but forgetting to put the fuel in.
Choosing supplements can be an absolute minefield, with so many
products, brands and choices being available today that it’s easy to go
wrong when making a selection. I’ve narrowed it down to the absolute
essentials that I have used with thousands of clients over the years and
which are the most scientifically backed in the market.
The key point to remember when buying supplements is to look at the
ingredients and not the brand. There are hundreds of great brands and some
not-so-great brands out there, but as long as the product you’re looking for
has the ingredients below in the correct dosage, they should work well for
you.
Furthermore, you should always choose your supplements based on your
goals and not your gender. If you are a man or a woman looking to lose
body fat, the same supplements will support you, but the dosage may be
different.
MUSCLE-BUILDING SUPPLEMENTS
1. Whey protein
The numerous benefits of whey protein include increase in muscular
strength and size, decrease in body fat and a faster recovery time.
Muscle protein synthesis is a scientific phrase thrown around a lot, which
basically means that this synthesis enables muscle growth and is an
important process for increasing muscle size and strength.
Resistance training alone can increase rates of protein synthesis. However,
it also increases rates of protein breakdown. For muscle growth to occur,
you need to tip the scale in favour of protein synthesis while trying to
minimize the breakdown.
Consuming whey protein post workout can substantially increase muscle
protein synthesis. Whey protein is a fast-digesting protein that enters the
bloodstream rapidly. This allows it to get to your muscles faster and create a
bigger spike in protein synthesis compared to food sources.
Dosage: The amount you use can vary depending on your body weight and
protein requirements, but 25–50g per serving for men and 10–25g per
serving for women 30 minutes after exercise is a good starting point.
2. Creatine
Creatine is the most scientifically researched supplement on the planet.
Without going too much into the science, creatine plays a vital role in
cellular energy production, as creatine phosphate (phosphocreatine), by
regenerating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in skeletal muscles. ATP is what
allows your muscle to contract when you work out.
One of the main functions of creatine is to pull water underneath the
muscle. This works similar to filling a plastic water bottle – if you press
down hard, the bottle will bend and crack, whereas if you fill it with water,
it becomes much harder to bend and crack it. The presence of creatine in
muscles has a similar effect.
If you have more water underneath the muscle, as creatine allows, your
muscle becomes more durable, meaning you can push or pull more weight
or do the same weight for more reps, leading to more fibre tears, which in
turn can lead to more lean muscle growth.
There are many forms of creatine, monohydrate, ethylester and tri-malate
just to name a few, but they’re all essentially creatine, with or without a
different ester attached.
Dosage: Depending on the form, a good starting point is 3–5g pre- and
post-workout for men and 1.5–3g for women.
3. Branch Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)
The BCAAs are made up of three essential amino acids: leucine, isoleucine
and valine. They are essential because the body is unable to produce them
from other amino acids, so they must be ingested through food or
supplements.
A large percentage of dietary amino acids are oxidized and wasted even
before reaching the circulatory system. The exceptions to this pattern are
the BCAAs: over 80% of dietary content of leucine, valine and isoleucine
reaches circulation.
Whey protein is naturally high in BCAAs, but adding another 3–10g
depending on your bodyweight before, during or after your workouts can
tremendously improve your recovery.
Dosage: The dose varies depending on your bodyweight and training
program, but a good starting point is 5–10g pre- or post-workout for men
and 3–5g for women.
FAT-BURNING SUPPLEMENTS
Fat burners can effectively aid fat loss when used properly. You must have
heard of fat burner pills that can make fat melt off your body.
Unfortunately, they don’t actually work that way. Fat burners are
supplements. They’re designed with ingredients that can give you an extra
boost to help burn fat. However, they can’t replace a good nutritional
strategy.
Think of fat burners like a scope on a sniper rifle, only in this case you’re
trying to shrink fat cells. Diet is the gun, the heavy artillery, and exercise is
the firepower. Fat burners may help you aim a bit better and kill fat more
efficiently. However, fat burners don’t work to their best effect when
they’re used improperly. They’re the figurative ‘icing on the cake’. So,
which fat burners should you use?
1. Caffeine
Caffeine is a staple ingredient in many popular fat-burning and pre-workout
supplements. It primarily helps you lose body fat in two ways:
1. By boosting your metabolism: Ingesting caffeine jump-starts the process
of lipolysis, which is when your body releases free fatty acids into the bloodstream
to be used for energy. In other words, caffeine boosts your metabolism and can
help you burn fat.
2. By giving you an energy boost: If there’s one thing that everyone knows
about coffee and caffeinated drinks or pills is that caffeine is a pretty strong
stimulant. It increases alertness and wards off drowsiness temporarily, which
means you can perform certain tasks more efficiently for longer on caffeine.
This applies for physical tasks as well as mental tasks. This means a little
shot of caffeine can give you the energy you need to give 100% during your
workout. And giving 100% in the gym means you’ll get the results you
want more quickly.
Dosage: If you don’t regularly ingest a lot of caffeine, a couple of hundred
milligrams or a strong cup of black coffee will likely produce noticeable
effects. You may want to start with 100mg to see how it goes and then up
your intake to 200mg. You can then increase the dose by 50mg if you’re still
not experiencing any effects. Do be careful not to overdo it as the side
effects of a caffeine overdose can range from anxiety and insomnia to death.
Take 30 minutes before your workout to release free fatty acids to be burnt
while you train and to increase physical and mental alertness. However, be
aware that caffeine has just over a five-hour half-life so if you take it too
late at night, it can negatively affect your sleep. This means that if you
consume 200mg of caffeine at 12 midday, 100mg will still be in your system
at 5pm.
2. Green tea extract
Green tea extract is probably my favourite fat-burning supplement. It has a
low-to-moderate dose of caffeine, and it has another ace up its sleeve –
polyphenols. These incredible polyphenols are vital for any person trying to
get lean.
In the scientific community, polyphenols are more commonly known as
flavanols or catechins.
The main catechins in green tea are epicatechin, epicatechin—3-gallate,
epigallocatechin, and the one with the highest concentration,
epigallocatechin-3-gallate or EGCG.
EGCG at a level of 45% or more (the percentage is on the ingredient list of
every green tea extract supplement) has the ability to:
increase 24-hour energy expenditure, burning more calories throughout the day;
increase the body’s key fat-burning hormone, norepinephrine, increasing the rate of
fatty acid mobilization;
prolong thermogenesis, increasing core temperature to burn more calories;
provide powerful antioxidants; and
support a healthy immune system, stopping you from getting sick.
Dosage: For both men and women, taking between 500 mg and 1000 mg of
green tea extract (with 45% or more ECGC) first thing in the morning or 30
minutes before training will support fatty acid mobilization and increase
metabolism for the rest of the day.
3. L-Carnitine tartrate
L-carnitine plays an essential role in transporting fat into mitochondria – the
furnace of the cell, where it can be burnt for fuel, which basically means it
moves fat from the back of the queue to the front to be used as an energy
source.
Without adequate L-carnitine, most dietary fats can’t get into the
mitochondria and be burned for fuel. This is one reason why L-carnitine is
considered a ‘conditionally essential’ nutrient – your body produces it, but
if it doesn’t produce enough, your fat loss can get seriously affected.
Supplementing with L-carnitine alongside caffeine and green tea extract can
dramatically speed up your fat-loss goals without having too much of a
‘negative’ effect on your central nervous system. If you think of your
metabolism as a fire, caffeine and green tea extract make the fire burn
brighter, and l-carnitine pushes the fat into the fire to be burnt as fuel.
Dosage: For both men and women, taking between 1000mg and 3000mg of
l-carnitine tartrate first thing in the morning or 30 minutes before training
can work very effectively.
CHAPTER 3
SLEEP
Sleep better and boost your energy
As someone who has been a notoriously poor sleeper most of my life, I find
it very easy to see how easily poor sleep quality can affect people’s
everyday lives. Poor sleep can affect everything from your energy levels to
your willpower, and from talking with large groups of people over the
years, I’ve noticed that a large amount of people have very poor sleep
fitness.
We waste time falling asleep and spend hours in a light sleep state, which
doesn’t have the same body and brain boosting benefits of deep and REM
sleep. In the past, I would spend an hour trying to fall asleep because my
brain wouldn’t stop rehashing the day’s events or would dwell on what was
coming up the next day.
I tried different supplements, going to bed earlier, going to bed later, but I
would wake up every morning still groggy. Sleep began to feel like a waste
of time. Not only would I lose an hour every night tossing and turning, I
wouldn’t feel any fresher in the morning and would feel like a zombie until
I had my first cup of coffee.
I’m not a sleep doctor, but I have spent years trying to figure out why I
wasn’t able to sleep better, and this allowed me to learn more about actual
sleep quality over sleep quantity. This is determined by how much time you
spend in actual REM and delta (deep, restorative) sleep.
Nutrition and sleep
Sleep is important because there is actually a direct link between your diet
and sleep. What you eat, directly affects how well you sleep. The quality of
your sleep also has a dramatic impact on your energy levels. Naturopathic
physician and founder of Biohealth Diagnostics in San Diego, California
Reed Davis talks about how ‘unless people get to bed by 10:30pm and get a
full eight hours of sleep, they’re wasting their money’. His philosophy is
based on the ‘circadian cycle’, which is a natural physiological cycle of
about 24 hours that persists even in the absence of external cues, i.e. the
way we’re designed to sleep based on daylight and nightfall – our body
clock so to speak.
I noticed that on nights when I got five hours sleep or less, I felt groggy and
tired and needed caffeine to get me going. Pretty standard, right? But the
same thing happened on the nights I got 10 hours sleep or more.
In contrast, something very interesting happened when I ‘split the
difference’ and got seven-and-a-half or eight hours of sleep. I felt great! If I
went to bed at 11pm and set an alarm for 6:30am, I found that I normally
woke up before my alarm and felt ready for the day. I tested this for three or
four months and found that I had more energy through the day and didn’t
need a nap (as I had done frequently in previous years) and I could function
optimally until about 9:30pm. At this time, I would normally start to
unwind for bed.
Why seven-and-a-half hours?
We’ve all been told, ‘You need to get at least eight hours of sleep every
night’, but why? Admittedly, I try and go to bed for 10:30pm to give myself
about half-an-hour to unwind. I normally read something that switches my
mind off, and then have lights out for 11:00pm. But I had to ask myself why
I feel so much better and have much more energy with seven-and-a-half
hours of sleep over, say 10 hours.
After a couple of hours, we enter the dream state sleep, known as rapid eye
movement (REM) stage 1. REM sleep normally occurs 90 minutes after the
onset of sleep, according to Dr Patrick Holford, author of Optimum
Nutrition for the Mind. If we are sleep deprived, it may occur within 30
minutes.
We have about four or more REM periods per night, and they go in 90-
minute cycles. That’s why if you sleep for seven and half hours and wake
up, you feel fresher, as you’ve finished that ‘cycle’ and your body finds it
easier to wake up. If you wake up after 10 hours, you’re mid-way through a
cycle, which is why you feel tired, groggy and need a ‘kick’ just to get
going the next morning.
Given that it is an essential way of resting, recharging and nourishing both
your body and mind, sustained, unbroken sleep and dreaming are a part of
our lifestyles that determine the quality of our lives and our health.
If you’re living in a state of high performance, such as studying, training,
working or are a full-time parent, then sleep should be a conscious act, not
something that just happens. You have the power to take care of specific
factors to make sure you’re tired when you decide to sleep. This includes
eating the right food at the right times, taking certain supplements and
minimising the use of technology that upsets your body’s melatonin
production.
Three ways to diet-hack your sleep
1. Fill up on fat: After reading David Asprey’s The Bullet Proof Diet and then
testing out the effects of medium chain triglycerides oil (MCT) on my body and
brain, I decided to use some version of MCT (from food or oils) throughout the
day. I’ve not only noticed an improvement in my sleep quality, but my overall
energy and brain ‘clearness’ throughout the day have improved.
‘Fat is a long burning fuel for your mind and body’
DAVID ASPREY.
The shortest-length fats of MCT oil are converted into ketones that are
immediately used as fuel for your brain, and MCT oil can also help burn body fat
while you sleep. I’ve noticed that I think faster and more clearly the next morning
if I’ve had MCT oil the night before.
I have also found that having slow-release complex carbohydrates such as oats
before bed also helps me sleep better. This is because in this case, you’re giving
your body some glucose while you sleep as opposed to ketones from MCT. Both
work great, and I recommend experimenting with both and see what works best for
you.
Note: If you’re not used to MCT oil, start slowly and make sure to mix it with
some other component. I normally use whey or vegan rice protein. Too much MCT
without your body being used to it can lead to a mild stomach upset.
2. The power of protein: Our bodies use protein for muscle repair and immune
function. In the training section, I have discussed how you tear down fibres while
you train. It’s actually your diet and sleep that repair these fibres.
The muscle repair occurs at night during your deep REM sleep, for which you
require raw materials (amino acids) to help heal and grow new tissues. I
recommend consuming a combination of a scoop of good-quality whey or vegan
protein with a tablespoon of MCT oil 30 minutes before bed.
Too much protein can raise the alertness chemical in the brain called orexin, which
can disrupt your sleep. Therefore, it’s important not to have ‘too much’ protein
before bed.
For years, I used to have two chicken breasts before bed thinking that it would
‘help me repair’, not realizing that it was massively disrupting my quality of sleep.
I scaled back 60g of protein to 25g of protein with 10–15g of fat or 20g of complex
carbs and my sleep has never been better.
3. Carbs before bed: As mentioned above, some slow-release carbohydrates
such as oats are a part of a great sleep hack. Your brain uses a lot of energy while
you’re asleep. One efficient form of brain energy comes from the sugar that is
stored in the liver, called liver glycogen. Your brain taps your liver glycogen before
hitting the stored sugar in your muscles (muscle glycogen). Therefore, having a
little carbohydrate before bed can help your brain function better and allow you to
relax and get into a deeper sleep.
As mentioned in Nathaniel Altman’s The Honey Prescription, a small amount of
raw honey has a similar effect on relaxing your body before bed. Furthermore,
combining honey with some MCT oil will not throw you out of the fat-burning
mode, as the shortest-length MCT derived from a supplement produces ketones
even in the presence of carbohydrates. Thus, you can stay in the mild state of
ketosis even while sleeping. I found taking both slow-release carbohydrates like
oats and honey in the combined form or by themselves to work great. Personally, I
find oats help me sleep better, but I have several clients who prefer not to eat ‘real
food’ before bed and find that the texture of honey works amazingly well for them.
How to supplement-hack your sleep
For some, using the food tricks and eliminating caffeine and stimulants
closer to bed time is enough to get a great night’s sleep. However, if you
find yourself really needing a supercharge, there are some supplements that
will work wonders for you by either helping you fall asleep or keeping you
in a deeper sleep.
Always check your supplements to verify their compatibility with
medications that you may be taking, as some vitamins and minerals have
been known to reduce the effect of some medications, such as birth control
pills. There are a number of great herbs and supplements that can help you
get a great night’s sleep. Here are some that I’ve found support me the best
and that don’t leave me feeling groggy in the morning.
Getting a great night’s sleep is great, but if you wake up feeling foggy, it
defeats the purpose.
1. Zinc
Zinc is an important supplement for male and female fertility and thereby
for libido, as zinc deficiency can lead to lower testosterone levels. Both
men and women need balanced testosterone levels for optimal hormonal
support. Zinc can support testosterone production by putting you into a
deeper sleep, which also improves recovery dramatically for athletes, as
zinc is one of the first minerals to get depleted in gym-goers and athletes.
Dosage: It is normally best taken at a dosage of 25mg per day with
magnesium (see below) and vitamin B6 (ZMA) – about 30 minutes before
bed on an empty stomach.
2. Magnesium
Nowadays, nearly everyone is magnesium deficient. Refined/processed
foods are stripped off their mineral, vitamin and fibre content. These are
anti-nutrient foods because they actually steal magnesium in order to be
metabolised. When consumed, if not supplemented with magnesium, we
become increasingly deficient.
Are you tense and tight or crave chocolate? Anything that makes you tense
or tight could be potentially due to a magnesium deficiency, which is one
reason why you may crave chocolate at night-time or when stressed.
Chocolate is one of the highest food sources of magnesium. The case of
consuming chocolate is a catch twenty-two though. Even though it has
magnesium, chocolate also has sugar. Every molecule of sugar you
consume pulls over 50 times the amount of magnesium out of the body.
Dosage Try taking 600–800mg a day 30 minutes before bed. However, be
careful, as too much too soon can give you a stomach upset. When you get
the correct dosage, due to its mild affect on your central nervous system,
you can find that you are much more relaxed going to bed.
3. GABA
An inhibitory neurotransmitter, your brain uses GABA to shut itself down.
It can dramatically calm you down when taken on an empty stomach. I
normally take it 60 minutes after my meal. GABA is great at bed time, but
can also be used during the day if you’re highly stressed or dealing with
anxiety.
Dosage: Start with 500mg before bed. This dosage can go as high as
2,500mg (incrementing the dose). GABA has also been shown to raise
human growth hormone (HGH) in the higher end of dosage (discussed
below).
4. L-Tryptophan
Also sold as 5HTP, L-tryptophan is normally talked about after Christmas
or thanksgiving dinner, as turkey is particularly high in this amino acid. L-
tryptophan can allow your brain to release serotonin (one of our brains
happy hormones), which can help you unwind before bed.
Dosage: Start with 500mg a night.
I’ve always been a massive fan of the ZMA, GABA and 5HTP
combination, which always allows my body and brain to unwind at the right
time, get into a deeper sleep and does not leave me groggy in the morning.
There is one other great supplement that can be included for shorter periods
of time, especially for the first few weeks of any new program in order to
get your body into a good sleeping routine. That supplement is melatonin.
5. Melatonin
It is a potent hormone and antioxidant that your body is supposed to
produce on its own if you get natural darkness (from the sun going down
each day) and enough sleep. When I struggled with sleep in my mid
twenties, I was getting neither, and a lot of people with sleep issues are the
same. There is a risk of your body stopping the production of melatonin if
you supplement with it, so I only recommend using it for short periods, not
more than 4 weeks at a time, and then taking at least four to eight weeks off.
Your body naturally regulates its production of hormones based on how
much of those hormones are present in the body. Therefore, if you
supplement with melatonin, your body will naturally produce less
melatonin.
Dosage Melatonin supplements can range from 300– 3,000mg. I tend to
stay on the lower end with 300– 500mg if I use it for an extended period (4
weeks) or use the high end 3,000 mg for 2 or 3 days if I need to recover
from jet lag. Keep this as a tool in your arsenal, but don’t have it as a staple
as with ZMA, GABA and 5HTP.
Human growth hormone (HGH) and sleep
During sleep, your body naturally secretes HGH, which maintains your
organs and tissues. Training and using the correct supplements can boost
HGH dramatically, but sleep is another crucial factor responsible for
maintaining optimal levels. As you get older, your natural level of HGH
secretion drops. Therefore, using hacks, supplements, foods and sleep can
give you all the benefits – lower body fat, more muscle, increased energy
and anti-aging to name a few. If you want to remain full of energy, in a
great physical condition and youthful, keeping your HGH high is critical.
All the supplements mentioned above can dramatically increase natural
HGH while you sleep.
How to avoid the night time second wind
There is a window from 10:45–11:00pm when most people naturally get
tired. This window differs a little, based on each person or the current
season, but it falls in with the general circadian cycle mentioned above. If
you don’t go to sleep then and choose to stay awake, you’ll get a cortisol
driven ‘second wind’ that can keep you awake until 2:00 or 3:00am.
This happened to me for years! If I missed my 11:00pm window by 15 or
20 minutes, I would get this incredible second wind, which was amazing
when I was eighteen or nineteen and going out to clubs, but terrible when I
was in my mid-twenties and had to be up for work at 6:00am.
If you can stick as close as you can to the circadian cycle and get to bed
before 11:00pm, you will wake up feeling more rested than if you get the
same amount of sleep starting later. I know it’s hard for some people,
especially if you work night shifts, as your circadian cycle is massively
disrupted. But I recommend experimenting with this trick for a week or
two.
Try going to bed at 12:00am, allowing for 30 minutes of unwind time
beforehand, and getting up at 8:00am. The following week, try going to bed
at 11:00pm and getting up at 7:00am and monitor how much better you feel
when you do the latter. It seemed crazy to me initially. I thought seven-and–
a-half hours sleep is seven-and-a-half hours regardless of when you get it,
but the results were very different when put into practice. It’s also great to
know about this second wind as you can choose to avoid it or take
advantage of it – some of my best writing and ideas have come to me
during this second wind. Just be sure you don’t have an early start the next
morning.
Switch off your brain
The problem usually begins before bedtime. You may feel unable to switch
off from feelings of stress, tension and anxiety. One thing that has supported
me massively is writing down all of tomorrow’s task before I get into my
night-time routine. For months, I found myself thinking about what I had to
do the next day, and it felt like my brain was going into an overdrive to
solve all of life’s problems at midnight! Writing down everything I need to
do the following day helps my brain unwind, safe in the knowledge that I
won’t forget my most important tasks.
When you get right down to it, food is one of the most important variables
that makes an impact on your energy levels and body composition. The
second most important variable – which is probably just as important as
exercise if not more – is sleep. You don’t need to necessarily use all the
tools, tips and supplements mentioned above, but having knowledge of
them can make a massive difference in your quality of life and in finding
out what works best for you and your body. By changing what you use, eat
and do before bed can give you an edge in all other aspects of your life.
CHAPTER 4
ALCOHOL AND HYDRATION
ALCOHOL
I have a little bit of a love and hate relationship with alcohol. I love nothing
more than a glass or two of wine with a meal, but I hate the feeling that
comes with going over that amount. My goal here isn’t to say alcohol is
good or bad. It’s more to give you an idea of what’s happening to your body
when you consume it and then let you decide if you should or shouldn’t
factor it into your plan each week.
Why alcohol can halt your progress
Alcohol is metabolized by the liver and thus drastically affects your blood
sugar balance, particularly when consumed on an empty stomach – this is
why you are ‘starving’ after you have had five or six drinks.
Drinking alcohol, particularly those drinks with added sugar, results in a
rapid rise in blood sugar. This causes your pancreas to release insulin in an
attempt to balance your blood sugar. Insulin circulates, does what it’s
supposed to do and then leaves you mildly hypoglycaemic (low blood
sugar), making sure you are excessively hungry after several drinks.
Therefore, on top of adding extra calories to your daily intake and
dehydrating you, your blood sugar levels also get negatively affected. Thus,
the next logical question is: ‘Does having alcohol with food minimize its
effects?’ Not quite, I’m afraid.
Alcohol also works as a ‘displacing agent’, meaning when you consume
alcohol with meals, it serves as a blocking agent, prohibiting the absorption
of several vitamins and minerals.
Alcohol, fat loss and muscle building
Now that I’ve explained how alcohol affects your body, let’s take a look at
how it affects fat loss and muscle gain.
On one side, your body will not burn body fat or build lean muscle tissue
while it’s detoxifying itself of alcohol. However, on the other side, alcohol
moves straight to the front of the queue as your primary energy source,
which your body will burn through it as its ‘go to’ energy source while it’s
in your system.
Your body using alcohol as its main energy source is a lot like your car
trying to run on water – it will just break down shortly after you get going.
Have you ever gone for a run or a gym session the day after you have had
four or five alcoholic drinks, to try and ‘sweat’ the alcohol out? And while
working out, have you felt like it was coming out through your pores as you
trained?
That being said, alcohol is one of the first things that I re-introduce in my
programs once people hit their target weight or physique. This is because
small amounts of alcohol, two or three glasses of wine on a Saturday night
for example, will go straight to the front of the queue to be used as energy.
So, if you train the following day, your body can potentially burn straight
through any alcohol you drink.
Further, irrespective of the above-mentioned negative effects of alcohol, the
feeling of relaxation you get with a small amount of alcohol can do wonders
for stress levels in certain people.
How to use: I recommend limiting alcohol until you get to your target
weight or physique, then re-introduce it once or twice a week.
Tip: There are roughly 64 calories in a shot of clear alcohol, Vodka and
Bacardi for example, and 82 calories in a glass of white wine. Beer has
between 200 and 300 calories per pint. If you want to keep your calories on
the lower side, limit your alcohol consumption to white wine and clear
alcohol and save yourself a fortune in calories.
Comparison:s
3 pints of beer: 600–900kcal
3 glasses of white wine: 246kcal
3 glasses of vodka and diet mixer: 192kcal
HYDRATION
Your muscles are composed of 70% water, and your brain is composed of a
whopping 95% water. Water is also the single most critical nutrient for
health, growth and development.
A 2% drop in body water can cause a small yet critical shrinkage of the
brain, which can impair coordination and massively decrease concentration.
Dehydration can also reduce endurance, decrease strength, cause cramping
and slow-down muscular response.
How much water do I need?
There is no ‘one size fits all’ to this question, but the general
recommendation is two to three litres per day for women and three to four
litres per day for men.
Of course, there are a lot of external factors that may require you to increase
this amount. If you train regularly or live in hot weather conditions, your
hydration requirement may go up.
For example, I train four or five times per week, so I normally drink around
four litres per day.
Let your pee be your guide!
Your pee is normally your best indicator of your hydration level.
If it is clear, you’re normally adequately hydrated. If it is light yellow and
has an odour, you’re one or two steps away from dehydration (light yellow
with no smell can come from supplementing with too much vitamin B or a
very high-dosed multi vitamin). If it is dark yellow and has an intense
odour, you’re probably dehydrated and not performing at your optimal
level.
How to drink more water?
The key to drinking more water can be as simple as always carrying a water
bottle with you. Leave it at your desk at work or beside you on the couch at
home. If it’s there and you see it, it will serve as an automatic subconscious
reminder to drink more and stay hydrated. This has worked great for me,
and I haven’t left home without a two-litre water bottle in about five years.
CHAPTER 5
TRAINING
I remember getting a gym membership from my mum and dad for my
sixteenth birthday and being extremely excited for my new fitness journey.
I had been lifting weights, doing push-ups and pull ups at home and now
that I was in the gym, I thought it was only a matter of months before I
looked like one of the models from the magazines. Turns out, it doesn’t
really work that way.
One of the most disheartening things you may face when trying to get in
shape, whatever that looks like for you, is putting in all the hard work and
still not seeing the results. You eat what you think is good food, use
supplements that you heard are good for losing fat or building muscle, and
on top of that, you train every day and you still don’t see the changes you
want to see. This can be incredibly frustrating. I remember how
disheartened I felt after my first six months in the gym.
I must have made every training and nutrition mistake you can think of – I
nearly quit a hundred times. This entire book is written on the premise that
if I had read it when I started, I would have cut my learning curve by years.
When I first began training, I found the nutrition tricky but do-able.
Supplements were a minefield, but when I indeed analysed this area, I
found that there are only a few that you actually need. However, training
was a different monster. I grew up with the mantra: ‘The more effort you
put in, the more you get out’. Therefore, to me, it sounded obvious that if I
trained three hours a day, I’d get three times the results. However, training
doesn’t really work like that.
A funny thing happened when I started to cut my workouts from three hours
to two hours and then to one hour – which is the most time I’ll dedicate to
workouts now – my body composition began to change, and I started to
look better!
To me, it defied all logic – surely three hours is better than one, right? It
turns out, your body is a complicated machine and like all machines, if you
overwork and put too much strain on it, it can break down. That’s what
happened in my case. To physically change your body, I’ve found the
optimal time to train is between 40 and 60 minutes a day, three to five times
per week. That’s not to say that you can’t do great things by dedicating
more or less than that, but I’ve found this to be the most optimal time in
terms of physical results.
The analogy I like to make for getting in great shape is that of pushing a
large and heavy wheel up a hill – it takes a lot of physical and mental effort
to get the wheel moving initially, but once you create a bit of momentum, it
becomes much easier. Keeping this analogy in mind, once you actually get
the wheel to the top of the hill, it takes much less effort to just hold it there.
Getting into the shape you want is similar. The beginning is hard, but once
you get moving, create momentum along the way and begin to see changes,
it becomes much easier. After you hit your target weight, body fat level or
look, it becomes easier to sustain, provided you continue to use the
blueprint that helped you get there in the first place – meal timings, making
better food choices, exercising for tension and intensity, etc.
The real key is to make sure you overlap your goals with your training
program. The truth is there is no single best training program – if there were
just one, everyone would have followed it, and all the other training
programs would have become obsolete. However, from my 17 years of
training experience and having worked with thousands of people, I can say
that there are certain systems, styles and programs that work great for body
composition, which I’ll discuss below.
What’s the best kind of training?
There are numerous different training systems and styles that can work
great for people, but I’ve found that in order to build a leaner, more
muscular or toned physique, there’s one thing that you need to do above all
else – tear muscle fibres by creating tension on the muscle.
Burn fat while you watch TV
Tension-style training elicits a significant tear in muscle fibres, which can
give a substantial boost to your metabolism. You burn more calories
through such training. Have you ever read about how weight training allows
you to burn calories while you watch your favourite TV show? Here’s how.
When you weight train or work for resistance in general, using body
weight, dumbbells, bands or barbells, etc., you tear more muscle fibres.
These fibres need repairing after every workout, for which they use calories
from the food and amino acids from protein.
Instead of those calories adding inches to your waistline, training
effectively gives them another job to do – repair from the workout. In order
for your muscles to repair, your metabolism has to increase, lending itself to
burning more calories while you rest. Tension-style training and HIIT are
great systems for ‘getting a better bang for your buck’, because you do less
to get more. Depending on the program you are following, those torn
muscle fibres could be repairing for up to 72 hours after the workout.
Therefore, the food you eat goes towards repair and not into fat storage.
Tension-style training
Tension-style training means keeping the muscle you are working under
optimal tension throughout the duration of the movement, i.e. two seconds
on the way down, 1 second hold at the bottom or top and two seconds on
the way up (2:1:2).
Have you ever done 10 repetitions of an exercise where you never really
feel the muscle you were supposed to work, but just did the exercise 10
times because that’s what was on your program or plan? The key to
changing body composition, increasing metabolism and building a leaner
body is to create tension on the muscle for every single rep. From the
several variations of tension-style training, my favourite is the 2:1:2
systems, combined with focusing on the muscle you are trying to work – a
mind–muscle connection. This style of training combined with the right
program can change your body composition very quickly when combined
with the right nutritional and supplement strategy.
Eccentric vs concentric
Just to expand on 2:1:2, you could use the term ‘eccentric’ (negative portion
of the rep) and ‘concentric’ (positive portion of the rep) to better understand
it. Every exercise below focuses on 2:1:2. Therefore, whether it’s a
dumbbell bench press or a leg press, you will lower the weight for two
seconds, hold and pause for one second on the bottom or top of movement
and raise the weight for two seconds.
You can vary this tempo for extra tension, replacing two seconds with four
seconds for example, on the lowering or raising of each rep. The take-home
message is that it’s not about moving the weight from A to B – the aim is to
create optimal tension for the duration of the movement and actually ‘feel’
the muscle you are working as a mind–muscle connection.
Mind–muscle connection
Have you ever just moved a weight from A to B, not really feeling any
particular muscle? You know it hurts and you are clearly working out, but
you can’t really pinpoint what muscle you worked? That’s from a lack of
mind–muscle connection.
It’s exactly as it sounds. You want your mind connected to the muscle you
are working. For example, if you are doing a dumbbell bent over row, you
want to feel your back on each rep. However, the closest muscles to your
grip are your forearms and bicep. Therefore, normally those muscles can
kick in and fatigue before you have even worked your back. This is where
the 2:1:2 system really shines, because you are not moving weight from A
to B; you are moving a weight with perfect form, creating optimal tension
on the muscle you are trying to work (back in this case) from A to B. This
way, you can create more tension on the muscle without having to go ‘super
heavy’, which increases your risk of injury and which will in turn massively
reduce your progress.
I’ve followed this exact training program, and I can only lift 4kg or 5kg on
side lateral raise for shoulders for example. If you are able to lift 25 kg with
perfect form on this movement, you either have super human strength or
you are swinging with momentum, meaning that you are not working the
muscle for optimal tension. The best piece of gym advice that I have
received was ‘Leave your ego at the door’. I generally find women much
better at this, but an added note for any men reading this: if you are trying
to get a leaner, toned and more muscular physique, but feel you need to
constantly out-lift your training partners with super heavy weight on a
bench press or a barbell curl, it might be worth considering that you change
your training partners.
Don’t get me wrong, you still want to find a weight that is heavy enough so
that you are failing at your given rep range. When I say I use 5kg on side
lateral raises, that’s physically the heaviest weight I can lift with perfect
form creating optimal tension on the side deltoid (the muscle I’m working).
You may need to use 10kg or 12kg to create the same tension. Just be
careful not to swing the weight with momentum. With the exception of a
system called ‘cheat reps’, where you use a slight momentum at the end of
an exercise when you hit muscular failure, if you are doing it from your first
rep, that’s just bad form.
Building a mind-muscle connection with every body part doesn’t happen
overnight, and you will find it much harder to connect with certain
exercises or body parts than with others. For example, it took me years to
learn to ‘feel’ my legs when I trained them. I would move a weight from A
to B, and my legs never really responded. It wasn’t until I learnt about
creating optimal muscular tension and started implementing it in my own
training that they responded. Now they are probably my strongest body
parts. So if you struggle to feel your glutes, chest or biceps, remember that I
was there too, but with the right system, you can turn your weakest body
part into the strongest.
Form: it’s not about the weight, it’s about how you move the weight.
Creating optimal tension and feeling the muscle you are trying to work is
indeed the secret to a better body composition. However, you also need to
do it right. When you hear people talking about their ‘form’, it’s actually
just the way you do the movement. If you do a barbell bent over row with a
curved back, that’s considered ‘bad form’, which basically means that
you’re not performing the movement the correct way. As you are not
swinging the weight from A to B, the beauty of tension training and 2:1:2
systems means you can focus on creating the tension on every single rep.
As mentioned above, I’m not saying to go super light. You want to pick a
weight that enables you to perform the movements within the perfect form
and fail  at the given rep range. This leads to one of my most frequently
asked questions: ‘How do I pick the right weight?’
How to pick the right weight
For example, if you’re doing your ‘push’ workout in the 10-rep range on
Monday, you’re moving a weight in the 2:1:2 system on an incline
dumbbell press and could have easily completed 12, 13 or 14 reps with that
weight, that particular weight is too light and you need to go heavier.
Conversely, if you’re aiming for 10 reps and fail at five or six reps, the
weight is too heavy and you need to reduce it.
The key is keeping track of the weight you used and always trying to fail at
your given rep range, which is 10 reps in this program.
Sometimes, you will get tired and fail before the 10 reps on your last set.
There are two systems that I would like to include here. One is a ‘drop set’
and the other is a ‘rest pause’ technique.
For example, if you are doing three sets of 10 reps on incline dumbbell
press with 20kg and on your third set, you fail at seven reps, you can either
drop the weight by 25% to 15kg and finish your last three reps (this is
called a drop set), or you can go back to your starting position, rest for 5 or
10 seconds and finish your three reps with the 20 kg (this is called a rest
pause). Both systems work incredibly well and can be used interchangeably.
My advice would be to use a rest pause on busier gym days, so that you
don’t lose your bench or need extra sets of dumbbells and use drop sets
when training at home or on quieter gym days.
What’s the best cardio?
Losing body fat and getting into your best possible shape may require at
least some aerobic activity. The range of aerobic methods and the different
systems available in cardio are many – enough to cause confusion for the
most dedicated fitness enthusiasts.
Aerobic activity by its very nature requires fat to be used as a primary fuel
source, with carbohydrates and protein being used to a smaller extent.
Therefore, if fat loss is your primary goal, some degree of aerobic work will
help you a lot.
Aerobic activities can include the following:
Running
Walking
Cycling
Swimming
Bodyweight HIITs
Resistance HIIT
There is no ‘one best cardio’ or aerobic activity. The key is to find the one
you enjoy the most, which your body responds to, normally by reducing
body fat and then using that as your primary source of cardio. If you hate to
run, try swimming or cycling. If you love team sports, join a sports club and
get your cardio that way.
Try HIIT cardio for faster fat loss
The two main types of cardio are low-intensity steady state cardio (LISS)
and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Both are great and both work
very well.
Low intensity steady state (LISS) is exactly as it sounds – it’s low in
intensity. For example, a 15-minute steady pace walk, jog or cycle where
you are at or above 70% of your max heart rate.
Note: 70% of your max heart rate is your ‘fat-burning zone’ – to calculate
your max heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, if you are
28, it would be 220 minus 28, which is 192.
LISS is a good tool if your diet is clean – your carbs are low and you’re
eating regular meals throughout the day alongside your weight-training
program. But I’ve found that you do need to do longer spells of LISS,
normally 15–20 minutes or more to see any noticeable changes.
HIIT on the other hand is ‘sprint training’. Its benefits are that it’s quick
(five to ten minutes normally), burns through more glycogen (stored
carbohydrates) and gives you a great feeling of accomplishment upon
finish. Its negatives are that it’s difficult. And when done correctly, very
difficult!
There are hundreds of ways to incorporate HIIT into your program (Tabata,
20:40 sprints, outdoor 20 –100m sprinting), but my favourite method is 10
minutes of 30:30 HIIT.
For 30:30 HIIT, you have 30 seconds ‘on’ or sprint time and 30 seconds
‘off’ for rest or recovery time. This can be done on a bike, treadmill, with
battle ropes or bodyweight movements (spider push-ups/burpee, etc.). The
key is to go as hard as possible for 30 seconds and then completely rest or
recover for the next 30 seconds.
Time your HIIT for faster fat loss
Depleting your glycogen levels by doing your weight training first and your
cardio after could potentially allow you to tap into fat stores more
effectively. Of course, as long as you are doing your cardio or getting your
heart rate up alongside all the other tips mentioned in this book, you will
burn body fat. This is just a quick tip that could potentially allow you to do
it faster.
To explain this further, check out the two hypothetical scenarios given
below: This applies to both genders so feel free to switch John’s name for
Jane’s below if you prefer.
Scenario 1
John Smith trains five days every week for 60 minutes on the cross trainer.
He had white pasta and chicken in his last meal. After 20 or 30 minutes on
the cross trainer, John finally depletes his glucose (from his pasta meal) and
is now using glycogen as his energy source. Another 30 minutes pass, and
John is still using glycogen as his energy source. He leaves his workout
happy that he got to the gym. Two months later, after going to the gym five
days a week, John hasn’t lost any body fat, built any muscle or changed at
all, and quits. Does this sound familiar?
Scenario 2
Jane Smith trains four days every week for 60 minutes. She does tension-
style weight training for 45 minutes and finishes with 10 minutes of high-
intensity cardio at the end of every workout. Her pre-workout meal was
chicken or fish, mixed vegetables and one tablespoon of almond butter or
150g of sweet potato. As she is focused on tension during her weight
training, she is burning through all the glucose in her body at a pretty rapid
rate – she’s not even half way through her workout, and is now very likely
to be tapping into her stored carbohydrates (glycogen).
Twenty minutes later, her glycogen is nearly completely depleted and she is
now using fat as her primary fuel source. She finishes her workout with 10
minutes of HIIT. Two months later, Jane is leaner, fitter, slimmer, more
toned, feels better and continues to train for the rest of the year.
Now, ask yourself which scenario you would.
Remember, progress is addictive: I don’t know a person in the world who
could continue a workout regime with absolutely no progress. So arm
yourself with knowledge and get better results in less time.
THE TRAINING PROGRAM
Push, pull, legs
There are hundreds of training programs that work fantastically well.
However, having worked with thousands of clients all over the world, one
of my favourite systems has to be the ‘Push, pull, legs’ split, as it allows
you to train every body part at least once per week or twice per week if
you’re training five or six days.
‘Push, pull, legs’ is the name of the training split for the movement patterns
of that specific muscle group. ‘Push’ refers to all the movements where you
use muscles that push the weight away from your body as their primary
movement pattern – chest, shoulders and triceps. In ‘pull’, all the exercise is
geared at pulling the weight toward your body as the muscles’ primary
movement patterns – back, rear delts and biceps. ‘Legs’ refers to lower
body-focused leg training.
How to lay-out your training week
First, I would decide on how many days a week you are committed to
training and then lay out your week around your schedule and lifestyle. I
find that three days a week works great for beginners and four to five days a
week for intermediate and advanced training. I like push, pull, legs, push,
pull for my own five-day training split, but you need to find what works
best for you. It’s similar to the best time of the day to train – the best time is
whenever it fits best into your schedule. If you only have an hour in the
morning before work or at lunchtime, then that’s the best time. If you use
training as your ‘de-stress’ from work, then evening may be best for you.
Laying out your week is similar. Your lifestyle might lend itself to training
Monday to Friday, taking the weekends off. Others will be better with ‘day
on, day off’, and those who can only train three days with Monday,
Wednesday and Friday. Find the day and time that works best for your
lifestyle and then adjust your schedule accordingly. Make training a priority,
but try to fit it around your lifestyle and not the other way around.
Training program details
Exercise: The name of the exercise you will perform.
Reps: The number of repetitions you will do, the number of times you will
perform the movements. For example, if you do the movement 10 times,
that’s 10 reps.
Sets:The number of sets is the number of ‘rounds’ you do. For example, if
you do 3 sets of 10 reps, you perform 10 reps of the exercise with a 2:1:2
tempo and then rest for 60 seconds. Repeat for your second and third set.
Rest: The amount of time you rest in between sets.
Tension: All the reps are at a tension of 2:1:2. Two seconds on the positive
(the upward motion), one second squeeze (at the top or bottom depending
on the exercise) and two seconds on the negative (the downward motion).
Cardio: All the cardio in this program is based on HIIT. HIIT burns more
calories, takes less time and works incredibly well to elevate metabolism
while burning fat when incorporated into a tension styled program. I
personally like using the rowing machine or a stationary bike, but HIIT can
be done on any cardio machine.
HIIT: For HIIT training, set a level that you can sprint as fast as you can
for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, reduce the level to a very easy pace and
recover for these seconds. Repeat this process 10 times for a total of 10
minutes.
Timing of each workout
Each workout should take between 40–60 minutes. This program is about
quality over quantity. Therefore, bring a stopwatch to time your rest
periods, train intensely while in the gym and get out within 60 minutes, so
that you don’t start to burn through any hard-earned muscle or overstress
your central nervous system.
Track your weight
As the weeks progress, your body will be getting stronger in each exercise.
Therefore, increase the weight every week (if needed) so that you fail at 10
repetitions during each workout.
For example, if you’re lifting 10kg on incline dumbbell press, you may
need to increase this to 12.5kg after one or two weeks as your muscles get
stronger.

CHAPTER 6
CREATING HABITS
Now that you have knowledge on how to use nutrition, training and
supplementation to increase your energy and get into a better shape, it’s key
to build a mindset that not only allows you to get what you want in the first
place, but also possess all the tools required to sustain it.
For years, I would get very close to all the things I wanted in life. I’d be
right on the verge of the body I wanted, leaving my job to start my own
business or within touching distance of some other goal, and I would
inevitably self-sabotage myself. Consciously or subconsciously, most of us
have done it at some stage. We convince ourselves that it’s not practical to
leave a job or spend an hour a day in the gym when we have children, a
full-time job and a mortgage to pay. We let the fear creep in, and this fear, if
left unchecked, can paralyze us. For years, I would let fear creep in, and
before I would know, I would be back to square one. This section of the
book is designed to help bulletproof your mind so that you don’t become
your own worst enemy on the path to getting what you want. As Buddha
once said, ‘Don’t let your own worst enemy live between your two ears.’
The section covers everything from creating habits and dealing with
anxiety, worry and stress to practical life tips that I read every morning in
the hopes of passing them onto my daughter someday.
The first audio book I ever listened to was The Power of Habit by Charles
Duhigg, which changed the way I looked at everything I did in my life.
At the time, I was working as a primary school teacher in West London and
had picked up quite a few bad habits: I would come home after work every
day, sit in the same chair, watch the same game show and have two or three
chocolate bars as I numbed out to TV. I was starting to lose my shape and
my energy levels plummeted. I had created a bad habit.
Creating positive habits and breaking negative ones
Charles Duhigg talks about the ‘routine – cue – reward’ system of habits. In
order to change a habit, you need to change one of the components of this
system. The routine is the actual situation or ‘trigger’ – for me, the routine
was coming home every day after work. The cue is what you do next, i.e.
getting two or three bars from the cupboard and sitting in the same seat
watching the same show. And the reward is serotonin release, the ‘happy
hormone’ your brain releases from the chocolate.
As soon as I realized this was affecting me negatively, I put plans in place
to change one of the components. For me, the routine of coming home from
work was always going to be the same, so I changed the cue. Instead of
reaching for chocolate bars in the cupboard, I left a pre-packed gym bag
beside the front door. I would come home (routine), pick up my gym bag
(new cue) and the reward came via the serotonin release from exercise.
Becoming self-aware of your negative behaviour, patterns and habits isn’t
always that easy to recognize. That’s why reading certain books is crucial,
as they can ‘point’ things out in a way that we may have missed or failed to
see.
I tried and lived my life by internalizing that there are only three ways to
look at most of the things in your life: 1) the things you know; 2) the things
you don’t know; and 3) the things you don’t know you don’t know.
I used and still use books, podcasts and following the right people on social
media to bridge the gap between all three.
The story of the boy and the tree
The Power of Habit made me understand that I was living in a pattern
without even realizing it. The book bridged that gap and put me in a much
more positive place mentally and physically. Some habits are harder to
change than others.
I remember hearing a story in my early twenties that I never truly forgot. It
was about a wise teacher and his student. Both were taking a stroll through
a forest when the teacher stops before a tiny tree and turns to his student
‘Pull up that sapling’, pointing to a sprout newly emerging from the earth.
The youngster pulls it up easily with his fingers. ‘Now pull up that one’,
says the teacher to the boy, indicating a more established sapling that has
grown to about knee-high length. With a little effort, the lad yanks the plant
and it comes off, uprooted. ‘And now, this one’, says the teacher, nodding
toward a more well-evolved evergreen that is as tall as the young pupil.
With great effort, throwing all his weight and strength into the task, using
sticks and stones, the pupil pries up the stubborn roots, getting the tree
loose. ‘Now’, the wise one says, ‘I’d like you to pull this one up.’ The
young boy follows the teacher’s gaze and sees a mighty oak, so tall the boy
can scarcely see the top. Knowing the struggle he’d just had pulling up a
much smaller tree, he simply tells the teacher, ‘I am sorry, but I can’t.’ The
teacher exclaims, ‘My son, you have just demonstrated the power that
habits will have over your life! The older they are, the bigger they get, the
deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big,
with roots so deep, you might hesitate to try to uproot them.’
Smaller bad habits like the one I mentioned above are easy to change by
understanding the ‘routine – cue – reward’ system – you just change one of
those components and you can effectively change your habits. Some habits
are harder to break than others, some have ‘deeper roots’ – for example, if
you have never felt confident about the way you look or have been
overweight your entire life, you’re not going to do something and wake up
lean and skinny or full of confidence overnight.
It’s the deep-rooted habits that are more difficult to change. It’s the small
things every day that allow you to change these habits. I have worked with
people who have been overweight their entire life who get frustrated when
they’re not lean in two weeks. If I said to you that I wanted to learn
Spanish, but I wanted to be fluent in two weeks, what would you tell me?
It’s probably not possible, right? But what if I said I wanted to be fluent in
six, twelve or eighteen months? Then it becomes a lot more realistic.
Breaking bad habits is the same – you’re not going to break a habit that
you’ve had for five, ten or even twenty years in two weeks. But by taking
the right steps, you could break it in six or twelve months and then be rid of
it forever. Aristotle wrote, ‘We are what we repeatedly do.’
Are you riding the horse of your habits and getting nowhere?
There’s a great story in Darren Hardy’s The Compound Effect about a man
riding a horse, galloping fast. It appears that’s he’s going somewhere very
important. A man standing along the roadside shouts, ‘Where are you
going?’ The rider replies, ‘I don’t know. Ask the horse!’
Darren Hardy describes that this is the story of most people’s lives – they’re
riding a horse of their habits, with no idea where they’re headed.
Psychological studies reveal that 95% of everything we feel, think, do and
achieve is a result of a learned habit.
We do most things in life in autopilot. When was the last time you thought
about how you tied your shoelaces or how you brushed your teeth? If
you’re like me, you probably even put on the same shoe first (left one)
every single day and don’t even consciously realize you’re doing it.
Thinking about habits this way can indeed help you understand how
important it is to create positive ones.
If you eat healthily, you’ve likely built healthy habits around food – what
you put in your shopping basket or what you order in restaurants becomes
automatic. The same thing happens if you eat unhealthily – you make
different choices automatically.
How to make the right automatic choice
The key is educating yourself about what foods are good choices for your
body and mind (see the nutrition section of this book) and then create habits
accordingly, so that those food choices become automatic. The key to
sticking to a good nutritional plan is finding or creating a plan that includes
your preferences – foods you like, enjoy and that work into your lifestyle
and schedule. If you can make your nutrition automatic, it becomes the way
you eat and not a diet you’re following. In other words, eating well
becomes a habit.
With enough practice and repetition, any behaviour, good or bad becomes
automatic over time. The key is having conscience thought and self-
awareness about which habits are supporting you and which ones are
destructive to your life. If your goal is to lose body fat, build more muscle
or have more energy throughout the day, understand which habits you need
to break or create in order to become that person. After that, it’s about
following the right habits on a consistent basis.
Even though we develop most of our habits unconsciously, by modelling
our parents, responding to environmental or cultural associations, or
creating coping mechanisms, we can consciously decide to change them.
Reflect on how deeply your habits are rooted and then put the plan in place
to create new positive ones in their place. Sometimes, it’s as easy as making
the decision and then using your ‘why’ to get you there.
CHAPTER 7
FIND YOUR WHY
The how means nothing until you find your why
Finding your why can be the ultimate difference between getting what you
want and giving up before you even start. All of the ‘hows’ mean nothing
until you find your ‘why’.
My ‘why’ is my little girl, Holly. The day my daughter was born, there was
a ‘fire lit under me’. I was doing okay before that – I enjoyed my life, I was
happy with what I was doing, but now it wasn’t about me anymore – it was
about us.
The reason my life took such a dramatic turn over the past few years is
because things like my health now became more important to me. I was
competing at the top level of my sport in competitive bodybuilding and
travelling the world as a professional fitness model, but I was living a
lifestyle that definitely wasn’t focused on my health – weeks before shows,
I couldn’t hold a conversation with people due to my body being so calorie
and food restricted.
I remember sitting in my living room on a cold autumn day, mapping out
the shows for that coming year. Suddenly, a vision came into my mind, of
Holly trying to play with me while I’m lying on a couch with no energy
because I’m ‘too tired’ and her saying, ‘What’s wrong with Daddy, why
won’t he play with me?’ That vision broke my heart and that was the day
my path changed direction. I had a new ‘why’.
If your why power (or desire) isn’t great enough, it’s likely that any goal
will end up like most new-year resolutions – you will pursue the goal for
two, three maybe even four weeks and then life will get in the way and you
will slowly or gradually stop or quit. We’ve all done that.
I will give you 100 euros to walk across this plank
Think of it this way: If I were to put a 10-inch-wide, 30-foot-long plank on
the ground and say, ‘if you walk the length of the plank, I’ll give you 100
euros, would you do it? Of course, it’s easy money.
But what if I took the same plank and made a rooftop bridge between two
100-story buildings? Then that money would not look as desirable and you
probably wouldn’t even consider doing the task for a second. However,
imagine if your child were on the opposite building, and the building were
on fire, would you walk across the length of the plank to save him/her? You
would be gone before you even thought about it.
Why is it that the first time you wouldn’t cross the roof top plank, but the
second time, you wouldn’t even hesitate? The risks and the dangers are the
same. What changed? Your ‘why’ changed, your reason for wanting to do it
changed. When the reason is big enough and your why is strong enough,
you will be willing to achieve your goal no matter what it takes.
I am fortunate enough to have an amazing life. I have what I call a ‘non job’
where my life and my job are one and the same. I have a healthy daughter
whom I love more than anything in this world and an inner circle of friends
and family who help me grow as a person. However, like everyone, there
are days when ‘I just don’t feel like it’. Even the most successful people in
the world (note: success is subjective to each person) have days when they
struggle. The only difference between them and everyone else is they use
their ‘why’ on those days.
I have a picture of Holly beside my bed and, on the mornings I don’t want
to get up at six o’clock, I look at that picture and remember my ‘why’. I
think to myself, ‘if I don’t get up, if I don’t work, she doesn’t eat’. That’s
extreme, but that’s the difference it makes between getting up and getting
dressed or hitting the snooze on my alarm. Finding your why, what drives
you, can make the ultimate difference between getting and not getting
everything you want in your life
How to find your why
‘All of us, throughout our lives, have learned certain 
patterns of thinking and behaving to get ourselves out 
of pain and into pleasure’
TONY ROBBINS
We all experience emotions like frustration, anger or being overwhelmed
and develop a strategy to end these feelings. Some people use food, some
use sex, drugs or alcohol. Others use running, going to the gym or reading.
Sometimes your pain point can be your strongest why. The pain of
envisioning my little girl upset because ‘Daddy wouldn’t play with her
because he’s too tired’ is a pain that completely shifted my focus in life. My
why is now to create and design a life where I have the time, money and
health to truly be present before my daughter and influence her life in a
positive way. Her journey is her journey, and I have no control over it, but I
have control over how much I am present in this journey and how much
influence, advice and guidance I can provide to help develop her character
along the way.
Your why might be completely different from mine, and you might even
have several ‘whys’. It might be a comment or a jibe from a friend or a
loved one that gives you that spark to get into great shape or a friend who
called you stupid that led you to read more books (my why for indulging in
reading).
‘your why needs to be greater than you’
ERIC THOMAS.
Pain and negativity can be powerful motivational tools and as long as they
don’t consume you, I think they’re vital for achieving great things in life.
Thus, on days when you’re struggling and want to give up, recall the pain
that made you get started and remember your why. Your why will keep you
going on the days you want to give up. Use your why and go get what you
want.
CHAPTER 8
STRESS
How can stress ruin your body and mind?
It’s three o’clock in the morning and you’re lying in bed. You have
something immensely important or challenging to do the next day – a
meeting at work, several lunches to make for the kids or an early morning
workout that you can’t miss.
You think to yourself, ‘What if I don’t hear my alarm and sleep in. I’ll miss
that meeting, my kids will starve or I won’t get time for my workout and I’ll
be in bad mood all day’. Next thing you know, the alarm goes off and you
were only asleep for a couple of hours.
You are incredibly tired but pull yourself out of the bed, get some coffee,
tea or caffeinated drink, go to work, eat something sugary or stimulated to
wake you up more, power through the day only to fall asleep in front of the
TV for 20 minutes from pure exhaustion before everyone else gets home.
You wake from your short catnap, jump up, make dinner or go to the gym –
finally catching your second wind. Then 11pm arrives, you settle down to
bed only to find yourself staring at the ceiling for the second night in a row.
Sounds familiar? This happens for two or three days in a row and then it
hits you – a cold, flu or just a general feeling of being run down and being
extra tired. Your energy is sapped, you find it even harder to get up in the
morning and you are counting down to the weekend so you can sleep in.
Looking at it, it’s pretty easy to determine that this probably isn’t the
optimal way to get into a great shape and have more energy.
Nevertheless, this was my life pattern for nearly four years when I worked
as a primary school teacher in London. I would lie awake in the bed on a
Sunday night worrying that I would miss my alarm the next day and my
whole week would be ruined.
Sleep, anxiety, worry and stress are something that have affected me a lot
during my life. Thankfully, since understanding what was happening on a
physiological and neurological level, realising that there was nothing
actually wrong with me and that those feelings were pretty common has
allowed me to find strategies to ‘hack’ that stress, worry or anxiety in my
own life.
I’m not a physiologist or a clinical psychologist. I am just someone who
was interested in finding out why I felt so anxious, worried and stressed all
the time. As it had a direct impact on my health, energy and fitness and of
those with whom I work, I always found myself fascinated by the
psychology and neuroscience about what happens on a physiological level.
Over a five-year period, I read and studied everything I could get my hands
on to try to educate myself as to why I felt this way.
The section will talk about how stress, anxiety and worry can negatively
affect your body’s ability to get in shape. I hope it will help you as much as
it helped me.
Understanding cortisol
Cortisol is your body’s natural response to stress, and it can be a good or  a
bad thing depending on when it’s released. Cortisol is a hormone released
from the hypothalamus in your brain (a gland that connects your endocrine
and nervous systems), pituitary gland (an endocrine gland at the base of the
hypothalamus) and your adrenal gland (an endocrine gland on top of your
kidneys).
All three of these glands work together as  an axis while utilizing
other hormones and precursors to make and release cortisol in times of
stress. We can be pretty thankful for our body’s ability to make cortisol
because if you needed to run away from a sabre-toothed tiger thousands of
years ago, you needed that instant energy that cortisol produces by engaging
our fight, flight or flee response.
Just like any other hormone, there is a delicate range of how much our
bodies can handle – too little or too much and things start going haywire.
Too much stress in your life keeps the cortisol pumping and can have
negative effects on your body, mind and physique. For anyone trying to stay
healthy and look good, this can be a critical factor that you haven’t thought
of yet. Stress is the figurative ‘death by a thousand cuts’ – you can get
everything right with your nutrition, training and supplementation, but if
you are in a constant state of fight or flight, stress or anxiety, you are going
to struggle to hit your own natural potential.
What causes stress and how to deal with it
Perhaps the best way to begin is by making a mental list of the sort of
things that you find stressful. You would no doubt immediately come up
with some obvious examples – a partner, family, friends who are always
negative, or something more abstract, things like traffic jams, the gym at
rush hour or work deadlines. You might even find things like ‘not looking a
certain way’ or ‘comparing yourself to others’ as your main stressors; two
areas I had issues with personally.
Thinking about these people, situations or events can trigger an automatic
release of cortisol throughout our body. Has someone ever made you so
mad that even the thought of them sent blood running through your veins?
That’s cortisol. Have you ever found your brain racing at 3:00am because
you are worried about not waking up from your alarm – yeah, cortisol
showing up. How about seeing that guy or girl that you find attractive who
you just can’t bring yourself to talk to?
That’s cortisol again.
As I’ve mentioned, cortisol in short bursts can be incredibly beneficial. You
actually release cortisol when you exercise, and it’s needed for your body’s
ability to release glucose from the cells. However, chronic cortisol or stress
can be detrimental to your physique, your health and your mindset. The
next section is dedicated to understanding all the stressors that can secretly
hinder your progress: anxiety, worry and some practical life tips that have
supported me throughout my life in reducing cortisol and stress.
CHAPTER 9
ANXIETY
When I used to work as a primary school teacher in London, I remember
regularly staring at the ceiling in my box room apartment with my head in
my hands unable to sleep due to anxiety. Practically, I knew how ridiculous
it was. I had a roof over my head, food in my stomach and a job to go to in
the morning, but I still couldn’t help the feeling that would well up inside of
me. I would lie awake worrying if I was going to be able to pay my rent that
month or about how my assessment at work would go the following week.
I actually felt like my heart was in my mouth, which would regularly lead to
sleepless nights and continued for over four years of my stay in London.
This of course eventually led to me consuming a lot of stimulated drinks or
eating sugary food the following day to try and pick myself up. This cycle
would ultimately keep me awake again the following night.
Every week, I would count down until Friday, so I could sleep in at the
weekend and not set an alarm. Of course, the anxiety would subside every
Friday evening, and I would stay awake until I was tired and then sleep
right through the night. But alas, Saturday night would come and I would
worry if I didn’t sleep well that night, then my sleep pattern would be out of
sync on the Sunday and I’d start the week off like I finished the previous
one.
When I look back now, I see how ridiculous the whole thing was. But this
pattern continued for months and months until I learnt that there was
actually a legitimate physiological reason that I felt this way. I had anxiety.
I always thought anxiety meant that you didn’t have your life together
(regardless of what you may see, nobody has every area of their life
together) and my only experience with anxiety was when work colleagues
would get signed off work due to stress.
I didn’t have enough self awareness to realise that it’s something that all of
us face at some time or another: for some people, it’s chronic and affects
them every single day, and the mere thought of something bad happening
can set them off. For others, it can be chemically induced (too much
caffeine, alcohol, drugs, etc.). Regardless, the more people I meet or clients
I work with, the more I realise that everyone experiences anxiety in some
way, shape or form.
‘I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most which
never 
happened’
MARK TWAIN
There are some serious cases of anxiety, and if you have suffered any major
physical or mental trauma or have a hormonal imbalance, it would be
probably best to consult your physician. However, I hope by sharing my
own experiences and strategies, I will ultimately support you in managing
any kind of day-to-day anxiety or worry that may be limiting you in any
aspect of your own life.
What exactly is anxiety?
Anxiety is a complex emotional response that’s similar to fear. Both anxiety
and fear arise from similar brain processes and cause similar physiological
and behavioural reactions: rapid heart rate, breathing disturbances and
‘heart in mouth’ feeling or the ‘fight, flight or flee’ response. The thing
that’s always made me curious about anxiety and fear (I regularly got them
mixed up) is that fear is typically associated with a clear, present and
identifiable threat, whereas anxiety occurs in the absence of an immediate
threat.
Fear and anxiety are so closely related that we regularly confuse them. We
feel fear when we are actually in trouble, like when someone overtakes a
car on the opposite side of the road and is coming directly toward you. We
feel anxiety when we have a sense of dread or discomfort, but at that
moment, we are in no immediate danger.
Everyone experiences fear and anxiety. It’s a part of everyday life and an
evolutionary adaption: fear and anxiety probably kept your ancestors alive
thousands of years ago – if you didn’t feel those emotions, you were likely
to be eaten by something higher in the food chain. However, all fear and
anxiety do now is make us miserable and unhappy.
Have you ever had a roof over your head, food in the cupboards, a nine-to-
five job and still worried about not having enough money in your bank
account? I know I have.
Have you ever seen friends in loving relationships and think ‘I’m never
going to meet someone’? Yeah, I’ve been there too.
How about those times when you felt just ‘off’ for no reason other than not
feeling right – you just felt on edge, but everything in your life was
perfectly fine. This affected me for years until I better understood how
certain food ingredients, (additives, flavourings etc.) of certain processed
foods had a direct impact on my mood and anxiety levels. If you want to
know more about this, take a look at the nutrition section of the book if
you’ve not done so yet.
None of these feelings are fear, as you are in no immediate threat. This is
anxiety.
Why your dog might be happier than you
Alongside cutting-out foods with those ingredients that sent my body into
severe ‘fight or flight’ mode and made me edgy for days, the biggest thing
that has supported me is knowing what was actually happening to my brain
when I started to feel this way.
You’re possibly familiar with the pre-frontal cortex – the ‘thinking part’ of
the brain. It’s what separates humans from other species – it enables us to
use reason, create language and envision the future.
Have you ever wondered why your dog gets happy every single time they
see you? Dogs and other animals haven’t developed the part of the brain
that allows them to picture the future, so when they see you, they are
completely present every single time. They’re not worried about when you
will go again, whether they will get food that day or any other scenario that
may or may not happen.
Although developing our pre-frontal cortex has allowed us to build
civilisations and create things beyond our wildest dreams, the trade off is
we can sometimes lack ‘being present’ – or being in the actual moment
because we are thinking about the future. Nine out of ten times, it’s
normally worrying about something that hasn’t even happened yet – work
the next day, paying our bills, etc. This is normally the foundation of
anxiety.
Fear is an immediate threat, whereas anxiety is thinking about a potential
threat. There are cases where there is a genuine hormonal disruption and
several of these people find western medicine great for their anxiety.
However, for a lot of us, it’s something we can control ourselves. I love the
quote: ‘Worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do but
you never get anywhere’. As someone who would be fine for several days
at a time and then get hit with a wave of anxiety like a brick to the head,
there are a few things that have massively supported me. So, I’ll share them
below in the hopes that they support you.
Anxiety hacks and how to deal with it
1. Recognise the source of your anxiety ‘Find the source, fix the
problem.’ For some of us, it is as simple as cutting the source of anxiety. In my
case, there were certain people in my life who just made me feel ‘off’. I felt more
insecure around them, and even though I called them friends, in truth, they
weren’t. Here is the test for it: do you feel worse after having hung out or spoken
to certain people? You may have been having a great day, but something they said
managed to bring you down, or you may have been having a bad day and they
made you feel even worse.
If there are people in your life that make you feel this way, I recommend
minimising the amount of time you spend with them, or as I practise, cut them off
completely. Sometimes, it’s as simple as finding the people who make you feel
happy and spending more time with them. Also, think about those who make you
feel unhappy and spend as little time with them as possible.
2. Train, exercise or meditate This was a bit of a Catch 22 situation for me.
For years, I used the gym and my training as an outlet, so they always acted as
plasters that temporarily healed the problem. If I felt I was on the edge, I never
dealt with it or asked myself who or what was making me feel this way. I just went
to the gym. I was effectively ‘self-medicating’ with exercise. In my opinion, it’s
actually the best way to reduce short, as well as long- term anxiety, but it’s
imperative to follow step one and then use training, exercise and meditation 
as ways to support you and not just put a lid over the real problem.
3. Don’t eat foods that make your anxiety worse This really could
have been number one, but as it’s discussed in more detail in the nutrition section,
it is number three on the list.
I lacked self-awareness in my early twenties so much so that I never added two and
two together in terms of how eating certain foods had a direct effect on my mood.
Knowing how certain foods can send my body into a spiral of ‘fight or flight’ has
supported me massively over the past few years. If your body is intolerant or
allergic to certain foods, or if you react to certain additives, flavourings and
preservatives that can be found in heavily processed food, then it’s worth keeping
note of how you feel if these ingredients feature heavily in your diet.
For example, I know if I eat too much dairy, sugar or gluten, my brain will feel
foggy the next day and I won’t have the same steady energy and mood that I
normally have. Everyone reacts differently to certain foods and ingredients, so
experiment with it yourself.
I’ve largely eliminated these ingredients and foods and very rarely get any
physiological anxiety issues anymore. If you still find yourself getting edgy and
anxious for no apparent reason – it’s not about money, a relationship or a job and
you just feel ‘off’ – then I highly recommend having a look at your nutrition and
checking if certain foods you consume are causing you to feel this way. See the
nutrition section of the book for more on this.
CHAPTER 10
WORRY
How to crowd worry out of your mind
I think worry and anxiety are two sides of the same coin – we are the only
species that have acquired the capacity to envision and anticipate our future.
We also have what’s called ‘theory of mind’, where I can think about what
you’re thinking about.
This can be an incredible thing – envisioning your future can allow you to
create and be the architect of the lifestyle you wish to lead. Your theory of
mind helps build incredible relationships with other people – the
relationships that normally thrive are those where you can perceive the
other person’s point of view, or figuratively, ‘put yourself in their shoes’.
Our brain, specifically our pre-frontal cortex, has evolved to do this, but it
also means that the same visionary mechanism can have opposite and
negative effects if we don’t manage it. Your brain is like a Rottweiler guard
dog – if you mind it, care for it and look after it, it will serve you for life,
but if you mistreat it or don’t look after it, it can attack you, harm you and
even kill you.
So what does that kind of negativity look like? It all comes under the same
umbrella of worry. Instead of focusing on creating your dream body, life or
job, you worry that you might not look good enough, that you will never
meet the right person, have enough money or that people may not like you.
There’s an incredible chapter in the book Social by Harvard professor
Matthew Lieberman, whereby they put people into an FMRI machine
(Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) – like an MRI, but for your
brain – which shows the section that lights up when we are left with our
own thoughts. When patients undergo this procedure after having just
performed a simple task and are then left to their own devices, the part of
the brain that is responsible for social relationships lights up. It happens
every time that we are not focused on a particular task.
This means that every second we don’t work, or when we are engaged in a
conversation or focusing on a task, our brain automatically starts thinking
about our social relationships – the ‘default mode’. Think about yourself.
How often, as you’ve been driving home from work, have you replayed the
conversations or interactions you had that day? ‘What did Suzie mean by
that comment?’ or ‘I wonder if Paul likes me?’ We’ve all done it, and again,
like most things, it constantly serves an evolutionary purpose. The more
social awareness and theory of mind we possess, the more socially accepted
we will be. Thousands of years ago, if you were isolated from your large
hunter-gatherer group, it meant you ended up as dinner for some sabre-
toothed tiger, so it was important to be accepted into the group.
This may explain why we have such a yearning to be liked and accepted.
It’s an evolutionary survival adaption. Like most things, when used
positively, it can enhance your life tremendously. Deep down, most of us
want to be accepted and liked by our peers and build positive and thriving
relationships with people.
But what happens when the desire to socialize isn’t positively channelled?
Those social thoughts that allow us to integrate better into a society can
consume every free moment, which leads to… you guessed it – worry!
So, the question is, how can I use this information to support my own life?
As someone who has spent a large portion of his life dealing with anxiety
and worry, my story and learning tips from it will hopefully support you in
moving forward.
Crying into a steering wheel until the penny finally drops
I will never forget the night when I nearly reached my breaking point. It
was a few months before my daughter Holly was born and I had just
finished working with twelve clients back-to-back. I was also preparing
myself for the Fitness Model World Championships in Las Vegas. I had
trained twice that day. I had more or less given up sleep at this stage, and
my anxiety and worry were at an all-time high. Whenever I got the time to
think, I would regularly ask myself, ‘What if I didn’t make the show? What
if there is something wrong with my baby? What if I can’t keep my
business thriving? All fear and worry.
I love the acronym of FEAR: False Evidence Appearing Real. Here’s why. I
had worked myself up into a frenzy and I remember parking outside my
new home and crying while simultaneously hitting my head on the steering
wheel for what felt like an eternity.
My body felt encased in a vice while the jaws were being drawn tighter and
tighter. All my worries and fears felt very real at the time, but looking back,
they were all illusions that I had created. My brain was over-thinking
everything that could possibly go wrong. I’ve since created strategies,
discussed below, that support me when any worries or fear feel like they are
taking control of my body or mind.
Socrates says, ‘know thyself’, and one of the greatest gifts that I will be
forever grateful for is my ability to see things before they actually happen in
the context of my own life.
I trained myself in this ability when I played top-level sports, when I
travelled the world as a professional fitness model and when I left the
teaching profession to start my own business that served people better and
on a much larger scale.
My own philosophy in life that has supported me greatly over the years is,
‘Become the person you want to be and then wait for reality to catch up
with that version of you’. I wanted to be a professional fitness model who
travelled the world, so I acted, lived and became that person until reality
caught up to me.
I wanted to create a business and a life that would help to serve as many
people as possible, and I have tried my best to become that person. My
biggest goal in life is to leave the world better than how I had found it, and
to instil my life’s philosophy into my daughter so that if she chooses to
stand on the shoulders of giants, she has the character and a belief in herself
to do it. I want the world to be better because we were here.
Sometimes, we determine our character by what we have or do, and that
allows us to become that person. For example, if I have a nice car or a big
house, then I will be successful, or if I do well in this show, test or exam, I
can become successful.
In my opinion, the sequence of actions in that model is wrong. It’s the ‘do,
have and be’ model. If I do or have this, I can be that.
I think a better way to live life is by the ‘be, do and have’ model – if I can
be this person, then I can do that and I’ll have this. If you want to be in a
better shape, you need to become a person who makes better food choices
and creates better habits that support that end vision. Become a fit person in
your mind, do things like eating well, creating supportive habits
accordingly and exercising more. Be, do and have.
The ability to see into my future in the context of my own life has been one
of my biggest drivers throughout my life. That night was an example:
staring into my steering wheel, contemplating why I felt this was my
turning point.
As I sat in the car feeling horribly sorry for myself, I looked into my audio
book library and re-listened to one of my favourites: Mastery by Robert
Greene. Suddenly, I felt as if a huge load was lifted from me. I was deeply
engrossed in the book, and I felt free, if only for a short period of time. This
was when I discovered my first trick to dealing with worry, which I call
‘taking control of your free time’, which ultimately is your thinking time.
Take control of your thinking time
The biggest difference in my life over the last two years, alongside the birth
of my daughter, is my ability to take control of my wandering and unhelpful
thoughts. Two years ago, if I were left to my own devices, my mind would
wander off to the social interaction conversations I had that day, and my life
never really changed. I had the same income, the same shape of mind and
body, the same network of people I hung around with – nothing ever really
progressed.
Now, I spend all my thinking time with audio books, podcasts or media that
supports my end goal in all the areas of my life. I consume information that
helps me on my own journey. I know that philosophy helps strengthen my
mindset, so I read Seneca or Marcus Aurelius before bed. I know that
reading books, going to seminars and doing courses on physiology,
biomechanics and nutrition allow me to build my own knowledge that can
directly impact the people I work with.
My advice would be to make a list of all the things you want in your life –
the body you want, the job you want, the relationships you want – and put
them all somewhere visible, where you can see them. After that, consume
as much information as you can that supports that end goal. When I wanted
to build my own body, I read every book and magazine that I could find that
would support the image that I wanted to create. Sixteen years later, I have
the body that I dreamed of having when I was thirteen years old.
Use your free time to consume the information that supports you in creating
the life that you want. Before you know it, even when you are left to your
own devices, your automatic thoughts start to manifest themselves in ways
that support your vision– not to the silly comment made at you during
lunchtime.
‘What you think, you become.’
BUDDHA
When the worry is bigger
We have all had those near-breaking point moments, which look different
for each person. It doesn’t matter how big or small it appears to you –
whether it’s the death of a loved one or nasty words aimed in your direction
by a colleague, it’s all relative.
There are times when needless worry kicks in, and that’s where taking
control of your free-thinking time can serve you tremendously. However, if
it’s something that’s continuously on your mind, you need to deal with it. I
find that most of my worries tend to dissipate during my free-thinking time
or when I exercise but there are times when it just keeps coming up again
and again.
So many people relegate their thoughts to, ‘It’s not important’, ‘Nobody
understands’ or even worse, ‘Nobody cares anyways’, but the reality is that
it’s relative. No worry is too small – worries are like seeds – if that seed is
planted and you leave it alone, it can grow into a mighty oak tree. Now ask
yourself, what’s easier – taking a bad seed from the ground or cutting down
a massive oak tree? Next time you think, ‘I’ll just forget about it, it’s
nothing’, think about that analogy.
Sometimes you just can’t avoid the conflict
I think conflict avoidance is one the biggest detriments to happiness and has
been the biggest factor in my own life for dealing with chronic worry. I
know that time and again, I’ve figuratively built mountains out of mole hills
by avoiding a conversation or a situation that I’ve built up in my own head.
I avoided the conversation or the situation because I wanted to avoid the
feeling of unease that I knew would inevitably come from it.
I would regularly avoid my inner conflict because of some story I had told
myself to justify the situation: ‘Oh I don’t want to hurt this person’s
feelings’ or ‘It’s probably not true anyway’, etc. There were times when I
just didn’t want to admit that I was too much of a coward to take ownership
of a situation.
Now, I like to think of tough words as workouts – all the growth and results
come from leaning into the pain of the workout. If you are too comfortable
when you work out, your body never really changes. You need to go outside
of your comfort zone.
‘the comfort zone is a beautiful place, 
but nothing ever grows there.’
VINCENT VAN GOGH
In the gym, your body responds by losing more body fat or building more
muscle. But when you deal with worry, your mind responds by making you
much happier. If you are worried about something right now and it keeps
coming up again and again, what conversation or situation are you
avoiding? That’s probably the one you need to have in order to rid yourself
of chronic worry.
CHAPTER 11
PRACTICAL LIFE TIPS
I have, by no means, figured life out yet, and truthfully, I don’t think
anybody ever does, but that doesn’t mean you can’t strive to get everything
you want. There are a few practical tips that have massively supported me
in my life, so I’m going to share them with you.
Think with the end in mind
I remember listening to Stephen R Covey’s 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People audio book, from which one section has always stuck out in my
mind.
He talks about seeing oneself going to the funeral of a loved one. Picture
yourself driving to the funeral parlour or chapel, parking the car and getting
out. As you walk inside the building, you notice the flowers and the organ
music. You see the faces of friends and family passing along the way. As
you walk down to the front of the room and look inside the coffin, you
suddenly come face to face with yourself. This is your funeral, three years
from today. All these people have come to honour you, to express feelings
of love and appreciation for your life. As you wait for the service to begin,
you see that there are four speakers. The first is from your family –
children, parents, aunts, uncles, nieces’ nephews. The second is one of your
friends, someone who knew you closely as a person. The third is from your
work or profession, and the fourth is someone you were involved with from
your community. Now think deeply. What would you like each of these
speakers to say about you and your life?
This section struck me more than anything else in the entire book. I
remember walking towards my apartment in East London. The streetlights
were lit and it was a cold, frosty November night. I stopped dead in my
tracks to contemplate what I had just listened to.
The vision that painted in my mind was so clear and vivid that it hit me like
a ton of bricks. It also dawned on me that I wasn’t happy with the answer to
the question that was forming in my head. That was the moment I decided
to leave London to pursue my passion. Shortly after, I left my job, moved
back home with my parents (broke and on welfare) and tried to set up a new
life, where my funeral would matter, where my life would matter. That was
the day when my mind shifted from being content with life to the seed that
was recently planted: ‘I’m only going to get one life!’
‘You only live once, but if you do 
it right, once is enough’
MAE WEST
The most fundamental application of ‘begin with the end in mind’ is to
begin today with the image or picture of your life and what you want it to
look like. The funeral scenario is the most extreme of cases, but the
paradigm or mind shift that I experienced that day stuck with me, and is
now channelled into all aspects of my life.
By keeping that end clearly in mind, you can ensure that whatever you do
on any particular day does not violate the criteria you have defined as
supremely important, and that each day of your life contributes in a
meaningful way to the vision you have of your life or as a whole. I once had
a talk with a client of mine who was looking to excel as one of the top
sporting athletes in the country and is currently on the brink of breaking
into one of the top teams where fame and recognition would be guaranteed.
We talked about beginning with the end in mind and working back from
that. I always try to follow the 10% law: your goals and targets should be so
high that even if you only hit 10% of it, you would have still achieved more
than 99.9% of what you ever dreamed possible.
I mentioned this to my client. I told him that if he wanted to make it to that
team, he would have to train, eat and live like the #1 athlete on the planet.
For example, when I competed at the 2015 World Fitness Model
Championships in Las Vegas, I aimed to win the entire show and become
#1 fitness model in the world. I trained, lived and made every decision as if
I was already that person. I managed to finish eighth, which made me one
of the top 10 competitors in the entire world. Had I aimed for top 10, I
probably wouldn’t have made the sacrifices necessary to move into that
bracket.
‘Aim for the moon, 
and you will at least 
hit the stars’
W. CLEMENT STONE
Funnily enough, my daughter was born a couple of months before that show
and my life took an entirely different direction: my health now became a
priority – it wasn’t just about me anymore. I now had a little girl who I
always needed to be there for, and my lifestyle at the time didn’t support
that new vision. My daughter saved me from things that probably would
have eventually affected my health. I started to think with a new end in
mind.
Is what you’re doing supporting the end goal?
I have three massive whiteboards in my bedroom. One has all my goals for
the next 12 months, the other 24 months and the third, the next 10 years.
If I am ever worried or unsure about a decision I have to make, I look at
those three boards and ask myself, ‘Does this support the end goal?’ If the
answer is ‘no’, I don’t do it; if the answer is ‘yes’, I go all out with it.
It’s incredibly easy to get caught up in leading a busy life, to work harder
and harder while climbing the ladder of success, only to discover that it’s
leaning against the wrong wall. The three whiteboards are my way of
making sure that the decisions I make are effective in moving me up the
ladder that’s up against the right wall.
People often find themselves achieving victories that are empty – success
that has come at the expense of things they suddenly realise were far more
valuable to them. For example, one of my main goals in life that probably
trumps all others is having a strong enough relationship with my daughter
so that I become her ‘go-to’ person in life. My mum has always been my
‘go-to’ person and I want to be that person for my daughter. I know how to
do this – I always need to be present with her.
Up until the last couple of years, too often, I would find myself taking out
my phone, scrolling through social media while in the company of other
people. What’s worse is they would be doing the same and neither of us
would see anything wrong in it.
I remember reading The Will Power Instinct by Kelly McGonigal, where
she talks about how it takes willpower to say ‘no’ to things and how to be
present with the people you care about the most. If you want a better
relationship with someone, be it your partner, your parents or your children,
be present when you are with them.
The book talks about a study done on husbands and fathers who were
physically present at home for at least six hours a day, but spent the entire
time either watching TV or working. In relative terms, this father or
husband would be with his family for at least six hours, but he wasn’t
present for the majority or any of the six hours.
In contrast, the study looked at husbands and fathers who were only home
for one hour a day but spent that entire hour engaging with their families.
There was no TV turned on in the background and no scrolling through
social media, just quality family time where there were no distractions or
‘noise’.
Obviously, the familial relationships of the one-hour dads were much
stronger than that of the six-hour dads, yet in relative terms, they spent
much less time at home.
The difference? Being fully present.
My end goal is to always be there for my daughter and have a relationship
with her, through which I can help steer her on her life’s path. To build that
kind of a relationship, I need to be present when I’m with her. This book is
my own reminder and a device of accountability that should help me retain
that vision.
How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important
to us, and keeping that picture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be
and do what really matters the most. Always keep the end goal in mind and
work backwards from it. If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall,
every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.
This can be applied to anything – I use the same techniques in my business,
my fitness goals and my personal life. You wouldn’t build a house without
first creating every detail and blueprint before you hammer the first nail in
place. Your life is the same. Create a blueprint for your life and then build
the life you want.
Don’t let negative people stop you
Something funny happens when you start moving in the direction of what
truly drives you to build the life, body or relationships that you really want.
Negativity from others starts to seep through.
This is something I’ve seen first-hand and personally struggled with. I even
had the quote, ‘The only taste of success some people get is when they take
a bite out of you’ posted on my wall for my first two years in business. This
was my way of dealing with negative comments that used to rock me to my
core.
You only have to go on social media to see some of the hate aimed at
successful people. Nobody kicks a dead dog, so if people are talking about
you, hating or nay-saying – assuming you are not hurting, harming or
neglecting people – it’s probably a sign that you are moving in the right
direction.
When I talk about negativity, I’m talking about comments and words
coming from outside your immediate circle of friends. When I think about
my circle, four names spring to mind immediately – people who have my
back and I theirs, regardless of circumstances. Think about the three or four
people, friends, family members or partners who have your back and then
do everything in your power to continuously build and nurture those
relationships. Provided they support you on becoming the best version of
you, then their opinions matter – nobody else’s does.
How to deal with people telling you that you can’t do something
‘There is nothing either good or bad, 
but thinking makes it so.’
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
We choose how we look at things. We retain the ability to inject perspective
into any given situation.
We can’t change the obstacles or perceived bad things themselves – that
part of the equation is set, but the power of perspectives can change how the
obstacle or bad things appear.
As someone who puts his thoughts, opinions and life applications out there
for the world to see, I leave myself open to criticism about my appearance,
ideas or philosophies. A lot of these can be perceived as negative comments
aimed in my direction.
‘Say nothing, 
do nothing, 
be nothing.’
ARISTOTLE
I made a choice a long time ago about how I would approach, view, and
contextualize any of that criticism aimed at me – I decided it was up to me
whether to accept it or not.
In every aspect of your life, it’s your choice whether you want to put ‘I’ in
front of something (I am angry with those comments, I am annoyed
someone would say that, I am disappointed that person used those words).
These add an extra element, which is ‘you’ in relation to the criticism,
rather than the criticism itself. The criticism is not you and you are not the
criticism. Those two things are separate, so let them go and don’t let it
consume your entire being. We go through our entire life worrying about
what other people think and make decisions based out of fear because of
what our parents, our friends or even strangers think!
When you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one.
With the wrong perspective, we get consumed and overwhelmed with
something actually quite small. Through the readings of Seneca and other
stoic philosophers, I can now see from the perspective that sometimes, the
criticism or negativity aimed in our direction is actually the other person’s
way of consciously or subconsciously dealing with their own demons.
Remember that choosing to accept negativity is your decision
It took me a long time to realize that a lot of the negativity I aimed towards
other people was a reflection of my inner self, which said more about me
than the person I was aiming those emotions towards.
I remember a close friend doing me a bad turn once. I hold loyalty and
respect as two of the main characteristics in my closest network and
‘talking behind someone’s back’ or to put it simply, ‘being two-faced’, is
probably the least desirable characteristic a person can have in my opinion.
Listening to destructive comments and negative stories from people who
were supposed to be your closest friends can be a difficult reality to process
– it can lead to a lot of built-up hate and trust issues.
Luckily, those circumstances can make you considerably stronger and more
self-aware if you allow a shift in perspective. Off the back end of that
particular situation, two things happened:
It allowed me to really figure what kind of people I wanted in my life and
what I valued most in others. I now have an inner circle of people who I
trust with my life. Jack Canfield says in his book The 20 Success Principles
that ‘success leaves clues’, but I think failures leave just as many – you
probably learn even more from your failures and bad experiences.
I also realized that those negative feelings or ‘hate’ were emotions that had
to originate within me for it to be even aimed in the direction of another
person. That particular situation allowed me to search for my own inner
hate and made me ask the question, ‘What was it that I hated about myself
that was manifesting itself in my feelings toward another person?’
The motivational speaker Tony Robbins regularly talks about the power of
questions. In this circumstance, I asked the right questions and I found the
right answers. I realized that it was my own demons that I had to first deal
with before I could release the hate or negative feelings towards another
person. Now when I feel moments of hate towards someone, something or
some idea, I recognize it for what it is – just an emotion. So I let it in,
allowing myself to feel it and then let it go.
‘Hating someone 
is like drinking poison 
and then expecting the 
other person to die.’
BUDDHA
Words are thoughts and ideas, not bullets
As mentioned above, hate is something that has to be within you in order
for you to project it onto somebody else; how to deal with it is down to how
you see it. My closest friends have referred to me on several occasions as
‘bulletproof’ when they see negative comments and words aimed in my
direction. I’m not bulletproof – the reality is, I see words as thoughts and
ideas and not bullets.
For one, thoughts and ideas change – my philosophies, opinions and entire
perspective on life is considerably different now than it was five or ten
years ago. Any negativity aimed in your direction goes with the moment.
Every moment is a new moment.
Sometimes, people hold onto the ideas and thoughts that may have held
weight in that particular moment in time, but that moment is temporary.
I remember family members telling me how stupid I was for leaving my
teaching job and trying to start my own business. Years later, the very same
people now talk about how they knew I was going to make it – the
circumstances changed, more information was now available. Enough time
had passed so that their subjective vision of success was now perceived to
have been achieved, and their opinions had changed.
The original ‘You’re stupid’ was now forgotten, relegated to non-existence
in the past and replaced with ‘I knew you could do it’. This is how people
are. Those thoughts and opinions are held for a moment in time and people
can change them with the turning of the tide – normally, when more
evidence is given to support or negate the idea but it is still just an opinion,
an idea.
We as an entire species once knew the world was flat but Aristotle argued
that the earth was spherical, because of the circular shadow it cast on the
moon during a lunar eclipse. We now know that the earth is round.
‘Everything we hear 
is an opinion, not a fact. 
Everything we see is perspective, 
not the truth’
MARCUS AURELIUS
But when these thoughts and opinions are aimed in our direction, we
consciously or subconsciously hold on to it like our first-born child!
Realizing that every word that’s ever been aimed in your direction is an
opinion of that moment in time can liberate you to do anything in your life.
The thoughts you have in your own head are what count. If you let other
people’s words dictate the direction of your life, you will never get what
you want.
When you start to see the world and all the opinions and thoughts in it as
simply a perspective, it can liberate you like nothing else.
Opinions and thoughts are what are felt in that moment, they’re not bullets
– they’re words thrown into the air – not even words cemented in stone.
They’re mostly words that float in air that we take in and allow to dictate
the direction of our lives.
It’s nice to hear people refer to you as ‘bulletproof’, but again this is just an
opinion of that particular moment – when you give words less weight, the
damage they do becomes a moot point.
One of the reasons I love my life is that regardless of the negative or
positive comments aimed in my direction, I’m going to continue to do what
I’m doing and just, ‘do me’. When you can truly let go of the thoughts and
opinions because that’s all they are, the world will be your oyster. Just ‘do
you’ and be happy.
CHAPTER 12
TEN LIFE LESSONS
‘Smart people learn from their mistakes. But the real 
sharp ones learn from the mistakes of others.’
BRANDON MULL
I remember the penny dropping when I heard this quote for the first time. I
was listening to one of my mentors and how they read books to learn from
other people’s mistakes.
I remember thinking, ‘I can literally delve into the mind of some of the
world’s greatest thinkers and actually see their thoughts’. For a long time, I
believed that thoughts become things. This was the moment when I went to
seek out some of the world’s greatest thinkers to try and influence the inner
workings of my own mind.
As a child with a love of sport, I would spend hours copying and replicating
the moves of my favourite footballers and soccer players – this would be no
different.
Instead of trying to solo off one foot and shoot with the other like the
football star Pat Spillane or step over and back-heel a pass like the soccer
prodigy Zinedine Zidane, I would practice using the mental strategies and
techniques that have supported some of the greatest thinkers in history to
strengthen and improve my own mind and my own conscience (and
subconscious) thoughts.
That’s when I learnt about Confucius.
‘When the student is ready, 
the teacher will appear.’
BUDDHA
Confucius was, in my opinion, the greatest Eastern philosopher of all time,
whose teachings deeply influenced East Asian life and thought.
He is considered China’s first teacher and his teachings are usually
expressed in short phrases which are open to various interpretations. Chief
among his philosophical ideas is the importance of a virtuous life, filial
piety (respecting parents and elders) and ancestral study.
In Yu Dan’s book Confucius From The Heart, he talks about the necessity
for benevolent, kind and frugal rulers, the importance of inner moral
harmony and its direct connection with harmony in the physical world and
how rulers and teachers are important role models for the wider society.
Sometimes when reading, I make notes of the things that come up that will
either lead to a blog post, a podcast or some other medium where I think
others may benefit from what I’ve read. This is what came up for me and
I’ve included it as the last section of this book as it’s something I still read
every single morning. I hope it helps.
 
ONE WHEREVER YOU DECIDE TO
GO, GO 100%
I have no regrets in life. I honestly believe that all the bad stuff and things
you would take back if you could, have merged the character of who you
are today.
That being said, one of the life advices I would give my younger self would
be, ‘Once you know what you want, go after it with all of your heart’. I
make all my life decisions on the simple premise that it’s either a ‘Hell, yes’
or it’s a ‘No’. If it doesn’t excite me, I don’t do it. If it does, I’m all in.
TWO EVERYTHING AND
EVERYONE HAS BEAUTY, BUT
NOT EVERYONE SEES IT
I have been a victim of this in the past. If someone has annoyed me or been
rude to me (rudeness is one of my biggest pet peeves), I have labelled them
as ‘being rude’. Rudeness, like most things that annoy us, is an action, not a
characteristic. Only when
I learnt to separate the thoughts of what they’re doing as an action and not
who they are, was I able to detach myself and realize that some people are
just having a bad day and it’s not a reflection on their character – and
definitely not a reflection on you.
THREE IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW
SLOWLY YOU GO, AS LONG
AS YOU DON’T STOP
‘Only dead fish go with the flow.’
ANDY HUNT
It doesn’t matter how slowly you are moving forward toward the life, mind
or body you want, as long as you’re moving in the right direction and ‘have
the ladder up against the right wall’, you will eventually get to where you
want to be. Remember Aesop’s
fable of the tortoise and the hare – slow and steady wins the race.
FOUR IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS, YOU
HAVEN’T ASKED ALL THE
QUESTIONS
One of the miraculous beauties of life is that we will never know it all.
Things change, ideas change, science changes – we are creatures constantly
evolving.
Around 330 BC, Aristotle maintained on the basis of physical theory and
observational evidence that the Earth was spherical (round) and reported on
an estimate on the circumference. Up until that point, we knew the world
was flat – just think about that whenever you think you know something.
FIVE LIFE IS REALLY SIMPLE, BUT
WE INSIST ON MAKING IT
COMPLICATED
Find the things that make you happy, do more of it. Find the things that
make you unhappy, do less of it.
SIX IF YOU HATE SOMEBODY,
THAT’S ON YOU, NOT THEM
Hate is a horrible thing to be consumed by, and it’s a basic human feeling.
Hate, like every other human emotion, is nothing more than a manifestation
of thought – you control it. Hate puts your mind into a negative place,
where the mere association of the person you associate this feeling with can
destroy you as a person and your underlying happiness.
Are there people I dislike? Of course! But hate, that’s an emotion I try and
keep out of my conscience and subconscious. ‘If it doesn’t support you, get
rid of it” – that feeling supports very few people and those that it did
(Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini to name a few), well, you know what
happened there.
SEVEN DON’T ADJUST THE GOALS,
ADJUST THE ACTION STEPS
‘If your dreams don’t scare you, they aren’t big
enough.’
ELLEN JOHNSON SIRLEAF
As human beings, we have put a man on the moon. We physically designed
a piece of machinery that could leave our atmosphere and go to another
planet.
Sam Walton (the creator of Walmart Stores) was worth 160 billion dollars
when he died – that’s one hundred and sixty thousand million dollars. Are
you telling me Sam Walton is one hundred and sixty thousand million times
smarter than you? I didn’t think so.
Next time you try to ‘get down four dress sizes’ or ‘get abs for the summer’
and wonder if you can do it, remember that as a species, we have put a man
on the moon. Aim small, miss small.
EIGHT RESPECT YOURSELF AND
OTHERS WILL RESPECT
YOU
One of my biggest goals in life is to instil the feeling of self-worth and
respect into my daughter. I would trade every single thing in my life to
make sure my girl grows up with confidence and self-respect.
I truly believe that respecting yourself gives you the confidence to be truly
happy in life. How can anybody else respect you if you don’t respect
yourself?
NINE WHAT THE HAPPY PERSON
LOOKS FOR IN THEMSELVES,
THE UNHAPPY PERSON
LOOKS FOR IN OTHERS
Happiness comes from within, it’s not a tangible thing. A nice car, a new
house, an attractive partner – none of these things in themselves bring true
‘happiness’ or ‘fulfilment’. They’re external sources that can be taken away
with a blink of an eye.
Sure, they’re nice for a little while and your ego will happily take the nice
comments, but again, those sweet comments are simply words from other
people. If other people’s comments are what’s making you happy, then
you’re always going to need something external or superficial to retain that
happiness.
Learn to find the happiness from within and you will always be happy.
TEN STUDY THE PAST IF YOU
WANT TO DEFINE THE FUTURE
'There is no such thing as a new problem, 
the answer is written down 
– you just need to find it.'
In conclusion, learning from other people’s mistakes or triumphs can allow
you to create any life that you want. As someone who has struggled with
energy, sleep, getting in shape and anxiety, amongst other things, and came
out the other side stronger because of it, I hope this books serves as a
blueprint to cut your own learning curve.
Remember that thoughts become things – the ideas you put into your head
become the thoughts that you have, and your thoughts influence actions.
The actions you take dictate the direction of your life. Decide who you want
to be and build your life around becoming that person.
If you want to have more energy, sleep better, have the body you always
wanted, or be the person who has the confidence to stand tall in any room,
then consume every bit of information that supports that vision. I hope this
book has helped to support you on that journey. Please share it with your
friends or family who you feel will benefit from it as well.
I’ll leave you all with one final quote that I think sums up this entire section
of the book.
‘When writing the story of your own life, don’t let
somebody else hold the pen.’
HARLEY DAVIDSON
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
My gratitude goes out to all those who have passed through my life. All of
you have contributed in some way to my journey and the substance of this
book.
First, I want to thank my publisher Lucy McCarraher and Rethink Press.
Without them, this book would not be possible.
My father Gerry, who has supported me through my entire life and nurtured
a work ethic that still supports me to this day.
My sister Karen, who has always been my second biggest fan in everything
that I do. She has been one of my best friends and is one of the smartest
people I’ve had the pleasure of knowing.
My team of Paul Dermody, Daniel Lupton and Emma Finnegan – while
writing this book, Paul,
Daniel and Emma allowed me to bounce ideas off them on a daily basis and
really helped the book take a certain direction. I couldn’t have completed
this book without their support.
Finally, to whom this book is dedicated – my mum Rita and my daughter
Holly. My mum and my daughter are the two closest people in my life. The
reason I couldn’t pick one or the other is because without either, there
would be no book. Without my mum, I wouldn’t be on my current journey
and have the mindset that I have, and without Holly, I wouldn’t have my
‘why’.
This book is dedicated to them, for without them, I would not be the man,
son or father I am today. I love you both.
Thank you.

FOREWORD
It is now more than a decade since this valuable publication was first prepared. 
It was compiled by a team of experienced nutrition scientists at the National 
Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, under the leadership of Dr. Kamala 
Krishnaswamy. It has received wide appreciation from the general public as well as 
from students of nutrition, medicine, home science, nursing and allied subjects, and 
has been reprinted several times. It has also been widely disseminated through 
outreach activities undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition, in the form of 
lectures, exhibitions and distribution of materials in various local languages.
In the intervening years, there have been notable socio-economic changes in 
India. It was thought necessary to update the guidelines in the light of new 
developments and fresh information.
The most notable change has been in the overall economic scenario in the 
country, with a robust growth rate. There have also been some important 
government initiatives in the fields of health and nutrition and poverty alleviation, 
including the launching of MGNREGA and overhauling of the ICDS. Globalisation 
has resulted in the opening of multinational fast food chains in Indian cities, 
including the smaller cities. Lifestyles and dietary patterns that had started giving 
early warning signals towards the end of the previous century, when these 
guidelines were first published, are continuing to follow a trend that promotes 
obesity and the attendant non communicable diseases.
The improvement in the overall economy at the macro level and concomitant 
improvements in purchasing power (though unevenly distributed) among 
households have not led to the expected levels of improvement in the nutritional 
status of Indians. The latest findings of the National Family Health Survey, NFHS-3 
showed virtually no improvement in parameters as compared to NFHS-2, and 
recent surveys by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau have thrown more 
light on the growing problem of the 'double burden' of undernutrition and 
overnutrition. These data should serve as a wake-up call to nutritionists and policy 
makers. There is very obviously an 'awareness and information deficit', even 
among the more affluent sections of the population, about good dietary practices 
and their linkage with good health. This deficit should be narrowed and eliminated 
by harnessing all traditional as well as modern technological vehicles of 
communication.
This updated version of DGI from India's premier nutrition institute, National 
Institute of Nutrition, should serve as a valuable source of concise, accurate and 
accessible information, both for members of the general public and those who are 
involved in dissemination of nutrition and health education.

PREFACE
The first edition of 'Dietary Guidelines' was published in 1998, and since then 
many changes have taken place in the country. The economic transition has 
transformed the way people live. Changing lifestyles of people both in rural and 
urban areas are seen to alter the very structure of our society at a rapid pace today. 
The shift from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased 
intake of processed and ready-to-eat foods, intensive marketing of junk foods and 
'health' beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as their dietary 
behaviour. Irrational preference for energy-dense foods and those with high sugar 
and salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially children. The 
increasing number of overweight and obese people in the community and the 
resulting burden of chronic non-communicable diseases necessitate systematic 
nutrition educational interventions on a massive scale. There is a need for adoption 
of healthy dietary guidelines along with strong emphasis on regular physical 
exercise.
Today, the multiple sources of health and nutrition related information tend to 
create unnecessary confusion among people. This book makes an attempt to inform 
us on matters of everyday nutrition in a user friendly manner and thus, aims to 
influence our dietary behavior. These guidelines deal with nutritional requirements 
of people during all stages of their life, right from infancy to old age.
We earnestly hope that readers will enjoy reading the book and benefit from it 
and also spread the valuable information among those around them.

INTRODUCTION
Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper 
diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development 
and to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and 
distribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The 
recommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and  technical in 
nature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components 
(non-nutrient phytochemicals) which have a positive impact on health. Since 
people consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather 
than nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to 
the food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines 
are a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice. 
They represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets 
that should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of 
nutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old 
age. 
Formulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing 
required guidance to people in ensuring nutritional adequacy. The dietary 
guidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological 
or high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and 
health personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the 
goals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition.
The dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the 
prevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the 
social,  economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines 
can be considered as an integral component of the country's comprehensive plan to 
reach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy. 
The major food issues of concern are insufficient/ imbalanced intake of 
foods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in 
India are low  birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy 
deficiency in adults, micronutrient malnutrition and diet-related non-
communicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of 
malnutrition (under
 and overnutrition) are important. Recent evidences 
indicate that undernutrition in utero may set the pace for diet-related  chronic 
diseases in later life. Population explosion, demographic changes, rapid 
urbanization and alterations in traditional habits contribute to the development of 
certain unhealthy dietary practices and physical inactivity, resulting in diet-related 
chronic diseases. 
The dietary guidelines emphasize promotion of health and prevention of 
disease, of all age groups with special focus on vulnerable segments of the 
population such as infants, children and adolescents, pregnant and lactating 
women and the elderly. Other related factors, which need consideration are 
physical activity, health care, safe water supply and socio-economic development, 
all of which strongly influence nutrition and health.
In this document, food-related approaches, both in qualitative and quantitative 
terms, have been incorporated. Emphasis is on positive recommendations which 
can maximize protective effects through use of a variety of foods in tune with 
traditional habits.  The higher goals set with respect to certain food items such as 
pulses, milk and vegetables/fruits are intended to encourage appropriate policy 
decisions. Suitable messages for each of these guidelines have been highlighted.
A variety of foods, which are available and are within the reach of the common 
man, can be selected to formulate nutritionally adequate diets. While there are only 
four accepted basic food groups, in India, there are a variety of food preparations 
and culinary practices.  Different cereals/millets are used as staple food, apart from 
a variety of cereal/millet/pulse combinations in different regions of India. The 
cooking oils and fat used are of several kinds.  The proposed guidelines help to 
formulate health promoting recipes and diets which are region- and culture-
specific. It is difficult to compute standard portion sizes, common to all regions of 
India. Nevertheless, attempts are made to give portion sizes and exchanges.  
Translation of knowledge into action calls for the coordinated efforts of several 
government and non-government organizations. The fifteen guidelines prescribed, 
herein, stress on adequacy of intake of foods from all food groups for maintenance 
of optimal health. Effective IEC strategies and other large-scale educational 
campaigns should be launched to encourage people to follow the dietary 
guidelines. Such efforts should be integrated with the existing national nutrition
and health programs.

CURRENT 
DIET 
AND 
NUTRITION 
SCENARIO
     Health and nutrition are the most important contributory factors for human 
resource development in the country.  India has been classified by the World Bank 
1
as a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-3945 . It 
th
ranks 160  in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian 
population, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be 
2
below the poverty line , which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an 
average, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban 
areas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable 
chronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced 
physical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines 
development. 
     Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A 
deficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) 
and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently 
encountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum  communities.
     Undernutrition starts as early as during conception. Because of extensive 
maternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy, 
nutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with 
3
low birth-weight (<2500 g) , as compared to less than 10% in the developed 
countries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even 
during early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of 
severe PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %, 
national surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from sub-
clinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which 
3
indicates that undernutrition is of long duration . The studies have shown that there 
is a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% 
4
at 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age . This is attributable to faulty 
infant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community. 
Persistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to 
short stature in adults.  About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body 
2
Mass Index (BMI) [Weight in kg/(Height in meter) ] below 18.5, which indicates 
4
Chronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1) . In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.8- 
1% of preschool children show the signs of Bitot's spots and night blindness.  
Vitamin 
A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death.

Among children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, a majority (70%)  are 
anemic. Nearly three fourth (75%) of women in India are anemic, with the prevalence 
5
of moderate to severe anemia being highest (50%) among pregnant women . It is 
6
estimated that nutritional anemia contributes to about 24%  of maternal deaths 
every year and is one of the important causes of low birth weight.  It adversely affects 
work output among adults and learning ability in children.
Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are very common among large sections of 
population in several parts of the country.  About 167 million are estimated to be 
living in IDD endemic areas.  Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid 
gland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental 
retardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular 
disorders. The most important consequence of iodine deficiency in mothers is 
cretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from 
the birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to 
maternal iodine deficiency.  Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter, 
7
2.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps .
India is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem 
of undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is 
emerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas. The prevalence of 
overweight/ obesity is higher among the women (10.9%) compared to men (7.8%) in 
4
8
rural areas . The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus  and Coronary Heart Disease 
9
(CHD)  is also higher in urban areas as compared to their rural counterparts. The 
incidence rate of cancer is comparatively higher among women (123) compared to 
10
men (113 for 100,000) .
The overall production of food grains (cereals/millets/pulses) recorded a 
significant increase from about 108 million tones in 1970-71 to a little over 230 million 
11,12
tones during 2007-2008
. Though the production of cereals and millets appears to 
be adequate, production of pulses, the source of protein for the rural poor, actually 
shows a decline.  Total Production of vegetables is about 30% less than the demand 
13
of 100 million tones . The total production of milk during 2006-2007 was about 100.9 
million tones,  corresponding to about 245 g per caput per day, which is lower than 
14
the world average of 285 g per day . Though the per capita availability of various 
foods stuffs is comparable to RDA, the distribution of foods, both within the 
community and the family, may be unfavorable to some vulnerable groups due to low 
income and purchasing power.  In view of the high cost of milk, a large proportion of 
the Indian population subsists on diets consisting mostly of plant foods with low 
nutrient bio-availability (Table 2). 
Food availability and consumption
5
4
National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) surveys  indicate that the daily 
intake of all foods except cereals and millets (396g) in Indian households is lower 
than the Recommended Dietary Allowances or RDA (Table 3). The average 
consumption of pulses and legumes like green gram, bengal gram and black gram, 
which are important source of protein was less than 50% of RDA.  Consumption of 
green leafy vegetables (<14g) and other vegetables (43 g), which are rich sources of 
micronutrients like beta-carotene, folate, calcium, riboflavin and iron  was  grossly 
inadequate. Intake of visible fat was also less than 50% of the RDA.
Table 3. Food Consumption (g/day)
*   Source: National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, 2006.
#   Source: RDA -2010 for moderately active person
The proportion of households with energy inadequacy was about 70%, while that 
with protein inadequacy was about 27%. Thus, in the cereal/millet-based Indian 
dietaries, the primary bottleneck is energy inadequacy and not the protein, as was 
earlier believed. This dietary energy gap can be easily reduced by the poor by 
increasing the quantities of habitually eaten foods.

On the other side of the spectrum of malnutrition, diet-related non-communi-
cable diseases are commonly seen. With increasing urbanization, energy-rich diets 
containing higher amount of fat and sugar, which also provide less dietary fibre and 
complex carbohydrates, are being frequently consumed, particularly by high-
income groups.  In addition, the urban population is turning to be more sedentary 
with little physical activity. Consumption of alcohol, providing empty calories, and 
tobacco use is also common among them. Hence, prevalence of disorders like 
obesity, heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure) diabetes and certain 
types of cancers is on the increase.
Widespread malnutrition is largely a result of dietary inadequacy and 
unhealthy lifestyles. Other contributing factors are poor purchasing power, faulty 
feeding habits, large family size, frequent infections, poor health care, inadequate 
sanitation and low agricultural production. Population living in the backward and 
drought-prone rural areas and urban slums, and those belonging to the socially 
backward groups like scheduled castes and tribal communities are highly 
susceptible to undernutrition. Similarly, landless labourers and destitutes are also at 
a higher risk.
The most rational, sustainable and long-term solution to the problem of 
malnutrition is ensuring availability, accessability and consumption of adequate 
amounts of foods. Dietary guidelines help to achieve the objective of providing 
optimal nutrition to the population.

Guideline 
1
Eat 
variety 
of 
foods 
to 
ensure 
a 
balanced 
diet
Rationale: Nutritionally adequate diet should be consumed through a 
wise choice from a variety of foods

Nutrition is a basic prerequisite to sustain life. 

Variety in food is not only the spice of life but also the essence of nutrition and 
health.

A diet consisting of foods from several food groups provides all the required 
nutrients in proper amounts. 

Cereals, millets and pulses are major sources of most nutrients. 

Milk which provides good quality proteins and calcium must be an essential 
item of the diet, particularly for infants, children and women. 

Oils and nuts are calorie-rich foods, and are useful for increasing the energy 
density  and quality of food. 

Inclusion of eggs, flesh foods and fish enhances the quality of diet. However, 
vegetarians can derive almost all the nutrients from diets consisting of cereals, 
pulses, vegetables, fruits and milk-based diets.

Vegetables and fruits provide protective substances such as vitamins/ 
minerals/ phytonutrients.

Diversified diets with a judicious choice from a variety food groups provide the 
necessary nutrients.
Nutrients that we obtain through food have vital effects on physical growth and 
development, maintenance of normal body function, physical activity and health. 
Nutritious food is, thus needed to sustain life and activity. Our diet must provide all 
essential nutrients in the required amounts. Requirements of essential nutrients 
vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. Dietary intakes 
lower or higher than the body requirements can lead to undernutrition (deficiency 
diseases) or overnutrition (diseases of affluence) respectively. Eating too little food 
during certain significant periods of life such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, 
pregnancy and lactation and eating too much at any age can lead to harmful 
consequences. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients, is needed throughout our 
lives. The nutrients must be obtained through a judicious choice and combination of 
a variety of foodstuffs from different food groups (Figure 1).  
Why do we need nutritionally adequate food? 
11
EAT SPARINGLY
EAT LIBERALLY
EAT MODERATELY
CONSUME ADEQUATELY
Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are macronutrients, which are needed in large 
amounts. Vitamins and minerals constitute the micronutrients and are required in 
small amounts. These nutrients are necessary for physiological and biochemical 
processes by which the human body acquires, assimilates and utilizes food to 
maintain health and activity.  
Carbohydrates are either simple or complex, and are major sources of energy in 
all human diets. They provide energy of 4 Kcal/g. The simple carbohydrates, 
glucose and fructose, are found in fruits, vegetables and honey, sucrose in sugar 
and lactose in milk, while the complex polysaccharides are starches in cereals, 
millets, pulses and root vegetables and glycogen in animal foods. The other complex 
carbohydrates which are resistant to digestion in the human digestive tract are 
cellulose in vegetables and whole grains, and gums and pectins in vegetables, fruits 
and cereals, which constitute the dietary fibre component. In India, 70-80% of total 
dietary calories are derived from carbohydrates present in plant foods such as 
cereals, millets and pulses.  
Dietary fibre delays and retards absorption of carbohydrates and fats and 
increases the satiety value. Diets rich in fibre reduce glucose and lipids in blood and 
increase the bulk of the stools. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates are healthier 
than low-fibre diets based on refined and processed foods.
Proteins are primary structural and functional components of every living cell. 
Almost half the protein in our body is in the form of muscle and the rest of it is in bone, 
cartilage and skin. Proteins are complex molecules composed of different amino 
acids. Certain amino acids which are termed “essential”, have to be obtained from 
proteins in the diet since they are not synthesized in the human body. Other non-
essential amino acids can be synthesized in the body to build proteins. Proteins 
perform a wide range of functions and also provide energy (4 Kcal/g).  
Protein requirements vary with age, physiological status and stress. More 
proteins are required by growing infants and children, pregnant women and 
individuals during infections and illness or stress. Animal foods like milk, meat, fish 
and eggs and plant foods such as pulses and legumes are rich sources of proteins. 
Animal proteins are of high quality as they provide all the essential amino acids in 
right proportions, while plant or vegetable proteins are not of the same quality 
because of their low content of some of the essential amino acids. However, a 
combination of cereals, millets and pulses provides most of the amino acids, which 
complement each other to provide better quality proteins.    
Carbohydrates
Proteins

Fats
Vitamins and minerals
Oils and fats such as butter, ghee and vanaspathi constitute dietary visible fats. 
Fats are a concentrated source of energy providing 9 Kcal/g, and are made up of 
fatty acids in different proportions.  Dietary fats are derived from two sources viz. the 
invisible fat present in plant and animal foods; and the visible or added fats  and oils 
(cooking oil). Fats serve as a vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E and 
K and carotenes and promote their absorption. They are also sources of essential 
polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is necessary to have adequate and good quality fat in 
the diet with sufficient polyunsaturated fatty acids in proper proportions for meeting 
the requirements of essential fatty acids (Refer chapter 7).  The type and quantity of 
fat in the daily diet influence the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. 
Diets should include adequate amounts of fat particularly in the case of infants and 
children, to provide concentrated energy since their energy needs per kg body 
weight are nearly twice those of adults. Adults need to be cautioned to restrict intake 
of saturated fat (butter, ghee and hydrogenated fats) and cholesterol (red meat, 
eggs, organ meat). Excess of these substances could lead to obesity, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease and cancer. 
Vitamins are chemical compounds required by the body in small amounts. They 
must be present in the diet as they cannot be synthesized in the body. Vitamins are 
essential for numerous body processes and for maintenance of the structure of skin, 
bone, nerves, eye, brain, blood and mucous membrane. They are either water-
soluble or fat-soluble. Vitamins 
A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, while vitamin C, and the 
B-complex vitamins such as thiamin (B ), 
1
riboflavin (B ), niacin, pyridoxine (B ), folic 
2
6
acid and cyanocobalamin (B ) are water-
12
soluble. Pro-vitamin like beta-carotene 
is converted to vitamin A in the body. 
Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in 
the body while water-soluble vitamins 
are not and get easily excreted in urine. 
Vitamins B-complex and C are heat 
labile vitamins and are easily destroyed 
by heat, air or during drying, cooking 
and food processing.  
Minerals are inorganic elements 
found in body fluids and tissues. The 
important macro minerals are sodium, 
14
Food Groups
potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and sulphur, while zinc, copper, 
selenium, molybdenum, fluorine, cobalt, chromium and iodine are micro minerals. 
They are required for maintenance and integrity of skin, hair, nails, blood and soft 
tissues. They also govern nerve cell transmission, acid/base and fluid balance, 
enzyme and hormone activity as well as the blood- clotting processes. Approximate 
calorific value of nuts, salads and fruits are given in annexure 1.
A balanced diet is one which provides all the nutrients in required amounts and 
proper proportions. It can easily be achieved through a blend of the four basic food 
groups.  The quantities of foods needed to meet the nutrient requirements vary with 
age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. A balanced diet should 
provide around 50-60% of total calories from carbohydrates, preferably from 
complex carbohydrates, about 10-15% from proteins and 20-30% from both visible 
and invisible fat.
In addition, a balanced diet should provide other non-nutrients such as dietary 
fibre, antioxidants and phytochemicals which bestow positive health benefits. 
Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, riboflavin and selenium 
protect the human body from free radical damage. Other phytochemicals such as 
polyphenols, flavones, etc., also afford protection against  oxidant damage. Spices 
like turmeric, ginger, garlic, cumin and  cloves are rich in antioxidants. Balanced Diet 
for Adults - Sedentary/Moderate/Heavy Activity is given in annexure 2 and figures 3 
& 4. Also, sample menu plans for sedentary adult man and woman are  given in 
annexure 2a and 2b respectively.
Foods are conventionally grouped as :  
1.Cereals, millets and pulses 
2.Vegetables and fruits 
3.Milk and milk products, egg, meat and fish
4.Oils & fats and nuts & oilseeds 
However, foods may also be classified according to their functions (Table 4). 
Requirements are the quantities of nutrients that healthy individuals must obtain 
from food to meet their physiological needs. The recommended dietary allowances 
(RDAs) are estimates of nutrients to be consumed daily to ensure the requirements 
of all individuals in a given population. The recommended level depends upon the 
bioavailability of nutrients from a given diet. The term bioavailability indicates what is 
absorbed and utilized by the body. In addition, RDA includes a margin of safety, to 
cover variation between individuals, dietary traditions and practices. The RDAs are

15
suggested for physiological groups such as infants, pre-schoolers, children, 
adolescents, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adult men and women, taking 
into account their physical activity. In fact, RDAs are suggested averages/day. 
However, in practice, fluctuations in intake may occur depending on the food 
availability and demands of the body. But, the average requirements need to be 
satisfied over a period of time (Annexure-3). 
Our diet must provide adequate calories, proteins and micronutrients to achieve 
maximum growth potential. Therefore, it is important to have appropriate diet during 
different stages of one’s life (Figure 2). There may be situations where adequate 
amounts of nutrients may not be available through diet alone. In such high risk 
situations where specific nutrients are lacking, foods fortified with the limiting 
nutrient(s) become necessary. A good example of such fortified foods is the salt 
fortified with iron and iodine.

Why additional diet is required during pregnancy and lactation ?
What are the nutrients that require special attention ?
Ensure 
provision 
of 
extra 
food 
and 
healthcare 
to 
pregnant 
and 
lactating 
women
Rationale:

Pregnancy is physiologically and nutritionally a highly demanding period. Extra 
food is required to meet the requirements of the fetus.

A woman prepares herself to meet the nutritional demands by increasing her 
own body fat deposits during pregnancy.

A lactating mother requires extra food to secrete adequate quantity/ quality of 
milk and to safe guard her own health. 
Pregnancy is a demanding physiological state.  In India, it is observed that diets 
of women from the low socioeconomic groups are essentially similar during pre-
pregnant, pregnant and lactating periods. Consequently, there is widespread 
maternal malnutrition leading to high prevalence of low birth weight 
infants and very high maternal mortality. Additional foods are required 
to improve weight gain in pregnancy (10-12 Kg) and birth weight of 
infants (about 3 Kg). 
The daily diet of a woman should contain an additional 350 
calories, 0.5 g of protein during first trimester and 6.9 g during 
second trimester and 22.7 g during third trimester of 
pregnancy. Some micronutrients are specially required in 
extra amounts during these physiological periods. Folic acid, 
taken throughout the pregnancy, reduces the risk of 
congenital malformations and increases the birth weight. The 
mother as well as the growing fetus needs iron to meet the high 
demands of erythropoiesis (RBC formation). Calcium is 
essential, both during pregnancy and lactation, for proper 
formation of bones and teeth of the offspring, for secretion of 
breast-milk rich in calcium and to prevent osteoporosis in the 
mother. Similarly, iodine intake ensures proper mental 
health of the growing fetus and infant. Vitamin A is required

during lactation to improve child 
and C need to be taken by the lactating mother. 
The pregnant/lactating woman should eat a wide variety of foods to make sure 
that her own nutritional needs as well as those of her growing foetus are met. There 
is no particular need to modify the usual dietary pattern. However, the quantity and 
frequency of usage of the different foods should be increased. She can derive 
maximum amount of energy (about 60%) from rice, wheat and millets. Cooking oil is 
a concentrated source of both energy and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Good quality 
protein is derived from milk, fish, meat, poultry and eggs. However, a proper 
combination of cereals, pulses and nuts also provides adequate proteins. Mineral 
and vitamin requirements are met by consuming a variety of seasonal vegetables 
particularly green leafy vegetables, milk and fresh fruits. Bioavailability of iron can be 
improved by using fermented and sprouted grams and foods rich in vitamin C such 
as citrus fruits. Milk is the best source of biologically available calcium. Though it is 
possible to meet the requirements for most of the nutrients through a balanced diet, 
pregnant/lactating women are advised to take daily supplements of iron, folic acid, 
vitamin B  and calcium (Annexure 3).  
12
Adequate intake of a nutritious diet is reflected in optimal weight gain during 
pregnancy (10 kg) by the expectant woman. She should choose foods rich in fibre 
(around 25 g/1000 kcal) like whole grain cereals, pulses and vegetables, to avoid 
constipation. She should take plenty of  fluids including 8-12 glasses of water per 
day. Salt intake should not be restricted even to prevent pregnancy-induced 
hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Excess intake of beverages containing caffeine 
like coffee and tea adversely affect fetal growth and hence, should be avoided.
 
In addition to satisfying these dietary requisites, a pregnant woman should 
undergo periodic health check-up for weight gain, blood pressure, anaemia and 
receive tetanus toxoid immunization. She requires enough physical exercise with 
adequate rest for 2-3 hrs during the day. Pregnant and lactating women should not 
indiscriminately take any drugs without medical advice, as some of them could be 
harmful to the fetus/baby. Smoking and tobacco chewing and consumption of 
alcohol should be avoided. Wrong food beliefs and taboos should be discouraged.
The most important food safety problem is microbial food borne illness and its 
prevention during pregnancy is one of the important public health measure. 
Avoiding 
contaminated foods is important protective measure against food borne illness.

Folic acid deficiency leads to macrocytic anaemia. 

Pregnant women need more of folic acid.

Folic acid supplements increase birth weight and reduce congenital 
anomalies.

Green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folic 
acid.

500 mg (0.5mg) folic acid supplementation is advised preconceptionally and 
through out pregnancy for women with history of congenital anomalies (neural 
tube defects, cleft palate).  
EAT FOLATE-RICH FOODS
23
POINTS TO PONDER
EAT IRON-RICH FOODS

Iron is needed for hemoglobin synthesis, mental function and to provide 
immunity against diseases. 

Deficiency of iron leads to anemia. 

Iron deficiency is common particularly in women of reproductive age and 
children. 

Iron deficiency during pregnancy increases maternal mortality and low birth 
weight infants.

In children, it increases susceptibility to infection and impairs learning ability.

Plant foods like green leafy vegetables, legumes and dry fruits contain iron.

Iron is also obtained through meat, fish and poultry products. 

Iron bio-availability is poor from plant foods but is good from animal foods. 

Vitamin C - rich fruits like gooseberries (Amla), guava and citrus improve iron 
absorption from plant foods. 

Beverages like tea bind dietary iron and make it unavailable. Hence, they 
should be avoided before during or soon after a meal. 

Commonly consumed plant based diets provide around 18mg of iron as against 
recommended intake of 35mg per day. Therefore, supplementation of iron 
(100 mg elemental iron, 0.5 mg folic acid) is recommended for 100 days during 
th
pregnancy from 16  week onwards to meet the demands of pregnancy.

Why breast-feed the infant?
What are the advantages of breast-milk?
Promote 
exclusive 
breastfeeding 
for 
six 
months 
and 
encourage 
breastfeeding 
till 
two 
years 
or 
more, 
if 
possible
Rationale:

Breast-milk is the most natural and perfect food for normal growth and healthy 
development of infants. 

Colostrum is rich in nutrients and anti-infective factors and should be fed to 
infants.

Breast-feeding reduces risk of infections.  

It establishes mother-infant contact and promotes mother-child bonding. 

It prolongs birth interval by fertility control (delayed return of menstruation). 

Breast-feeding helps in retraction of the uterus. 

Incidence of breast cancer is lower in mothers who breast feed their children. 

Breast feeding is associated with better cognitive development of children and 
may provide some long-term health benefits.
Breast-milk contains all essential nutrients needed for the infant; it provides the 
best nutrition and protects the infant from infections. Breast-milk is a natural food 
and is more easily digested and absorbed by the infant as compared to formula milk 
prepared from other sources. Colostrum, which is the milk secreted during the first 3-
4 days after child birth, is rich in proteins, minerals, vitamins especially vitamin A and 
antibodies. In addition, it has a laxative effect as well. Breast-feeding helps in 
reducing fertility and facilitates spacing of children. Lactation provides emotional 
satisfaction to the mother and the infant. Recent evidence suggests that human milk 
may confer some long term benefits such as lower risk of certain autoimmune 
diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and related disorders and probably 
some cancers. Therefore, breast milk is the best milk for the newborn and growing 
infant.
In addition to providing nutrients, breast-milk has several special components 
such as growth factors, enzymes, hormones and anti-infective factors. The amount 
 Exclusive breast-feeding ensures safe nutrition to the infant 
and all round development of health
25
of milk secreted increases gradually in the first few days after delivery, reaching the 
peak during the second month, at which level it is maintained until about 6 months of 
age. An average Indian woman secretes about 750 ml of milk per day during the first 
6 months and 600 ml/day subsequently up to one year. Many essential components 
are in concentrated amounts in colostrum as compared to mature milk, 
compensating for the low output during early lactation.
Breast-milk provides good quality proteins, fat, vitamins, calcium, iron and other 
minerals up to 4-6 months. In fact, quality of some of the nutrients can be improved 
by supplementing the diet of the mother with nutrients. Growth performance of 
majority of the breast-fed infants is satisfactory up to 6 months of age.  Breast 
feeding is associated with better cognitive development possibly due to the high 
content of docosahexaeonic acid (DHA) which plays an important role in brain 
development.
Mother-infant contact should be established as early 
as possible (immediately after birth) by permitting the 
infant to suck at the breast. Mothers can breast-feed 
from as early as 30 minutes after delivery. 
Colostrum should be made available to the infant 
immediately after birth. Feeding honey, glucose, 
water or dilute milk formula before lactation should be 
avoided and the infant should be allowed to suck, which 
helps in establishing lactation. Colostrum should not be 
discarded, as is sometimes practiced. 
Breast-feeding in India is common among the rural and urban poor, being less so 
among the urban middle and upper classes. The poorer groups continue breast-
feeding for longer duration than the educated upper and middle income groups. The 
economically advantaged or the working mother tends to discontinue breast-feeding 
early. A baby should be exclusively breast-fed only up to 6 months and comple-
mentary foods should be introduced thereafter. Breast-feeding can be continued as 
long as possible, even up to 2 years. Demand feeding helps in maintaining lactation 
for a longer time. If babies are quiet or sleep for 2 hours after a feed and show 
adequate weight gain, feeding may be assumed as adequate. Breast-fed infants do 
not need additional water. Feeding water reduces the breast milk intake and 
increases the risk of diarrhoea and should, therefore, be avoided. Giving additional 
water is unnecessary even in hot climate.
When to start breast feeding and how long to continue?
26
What are the effects of maternal malnutrition on breast-milk?
How does breast-milk protect against infection ?
What ensures an adequate supply of breast-milk?
Are drugs secreted in breast-milk ? 
Composition of breast-milk depends to some extent on maternal nutrition.  In 
general, even the undernourished mothers can successfully breast-feed. But in the 
case of severe malnutrition, both the quality and quantity of breast-milk may be 
affected. Protein content of breast-milk appears to be much less affected as 
compared to fat in malnutrition. Concentration of water-soluble vitamins as well as 
fat soluble vitamin A (beta-carotene) is influenced by the quality of the maternal diet.  
Supplementation of vitamins A and B-complex to lactating mothers increases the 
levels of these vitamins in breast-milk. Zinc and iron from breast-milk are better 
absorbed than from other food sources. Trace element composition of breast-milk, 
however, is not affected by the mother's nutritional status. 
Diseases and death among breast-fed infants are much lower than those among 
formula-fed infants. Breast-feeding protects against diarrhoea and upper respiratory 
tract infections. The bifidus factor in breast-milk promotes the natural gut flora. The 
gut flora and the low pH of breast-milk inhibit the growth of pathogens. Breast-milk 
has immunoglobulins (IgA), lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and complements which 
protect the infant from several infections. Antibodies to E-coli and some viruses are 
found in breast milk, which protect the gut mucosa. Breast-feeding also protects 
infants from vulnerability to  allergic reactions. 
It is necessary that the woman is emotionally prepared during pregnancy for 
breast-feeding and is encouraged to eat a well-balanced diet. 
Anxiety and emotional 
upset must be avoided and adequate rest should be ensured. It is necessary to 
prepare the breast, particularly the nipple, for breast-feeding. Mother should initiate 
breast-feeding as early as possible after delivery and feed the child on demand. Milk 
production of the mother is determined by the infant’s demand. Frequent sucking by 
the baby and complete emptying of breast are important for sustaining adequate 
breast milk output. A working mother can express her breast milk and store it 
hygienically up to 8 hrs. This can be fed to her infant by the caretaker. 
Since, drugs (antibiotics, caffeine, hormones and alcohol) are secreted into the 
breast-milk and could prove harmful to the breast-fed infant, caution should be 
exercised by the lactating mother while taking medicines. 
27
Should HIV positive women breast feed their babies?
HIV may be transmitted from mother to infant through breast milk. However, 
women living in the resource poor settings in developing countries may not have 
access to safe, hygienic and affordable replacement feeding options. Considering 
the important role of breast milk in child growth and development, following 
recommendations have been proposed by National AIDS Control Organization 
(NACO). When replacement feeding is not acceptable, feasible, affordable, 
sustainable and safe (AFASS), exclusive breast-feeding is recommended during the 
first months of life. Every effort should be made to promote exclusive breast-feeding 
for up to four months in the case of HIV positive mothers followed by weaning, and 
complete stoppage of breast feeding at six months in order to restrict transmission 
through breast feeding. However, such mothers will be informed about the risk of 
transmission of HIV through breast milk and its consequences. In addition, based on 
the principle of informed choice, HIV infected women should be counseled about the 
risk of HIV transmission through breast milk and the risks and benefits of each 
feeding method, with specific guidance in selecting the option most likely to be 
suitable for their situation. In any case, mixed feeding i.e. breast-feeding along with 
other feeds should be strictly discouraged as it increases the risk of HIV 
transmission.

Start breast-feeding within an hour after delivery and do not discard 
colostrum. 

Breast-feed exclusively (not even water) for a minimum of six months 
if the growth of the infant is adequate.  

Continue breast-feeding in addition to nutrient-rich complementary 
foods (weaning foods), preferably up to 2 years.  

Breast-feed the infant frequently and on demand to establish and 
maintain good milk supply. 

Take a nutritionally adequate diet both during pregnancy and lactation. 

Avoid tobacco (smoking and chewing), alcohol and drugs during 
lactation. 

Ensure active family support for breast-feeding.

What are supplementary/complementary foods?
Why use complementary foods and when? 
Feed 
home 
based 
semi-solid 
foods 
to 
the 
infant 
after 
six 
months
Rationale: 

Breast-milk alone is not adequate for the infant beyond 6 months of age. 

Introduction of food supplements (semi-solid complementary foods) along 
with breast-feeding is necessary for infants after 6 months of age. 

Provision of adequate and appropriate supplements to young children 
prevents malnutrition. 

Hygienic practices should be observed while preparing and feeding the 
complementary food to the child; otherwise, it will lead to diarrhoea.
It is well accepted that breast milk is the best food for an infant. Fortunately, in 
India, most rural mothers are able to breast-feed their children for prolonged periods.  
In fact, this is a boon to Indian children as otherwise the prevalence of under-nutrition 
among them would have been much higher. However, often, children are solely 
breast-fed even beyond the age of one year in the belief that breast-milk alone is 
adequate for the child until he/she is able to pick up food and eat. This practice 
results in under-nutrition among young children. Working mothers, on the other 
hand are unable to breast-feed their children for longer periods, as they go to work 
outside.  
Foods that are regularly fed to the infant, in addition to breast-milk, providing 
sufficient nutrients are known as supplementary or complementary foods. These 
could be liquids like milk or semi-solids like 'kheer' in the case of infants or solid 
preparations like rice etc., in the case of children over the age of one year. 
At birth, mother's milk alone is adequate for the infant. Requirements of all the 
nutrients progressively increase with the infant's growth. Simultaneously, the breast-
milk secretion in the mother comes down with time. Thus, infants are deprived of 
adequate nutrients due to the dual factors of increased nutrient requirements and 
decreased availability of breast-milk. Usually, these changes occur at about 6 
months of age. Hence, promotion of optimal growth in infants, calls for introduction of 
adequate food supplements in addition to continued breast feeding, from  the age of 
6 months onwards. 
Easy to cook home made preparations are hygenic and 
healthy foods for the growing baby
29
Can home-made recipes be nutritious supplements?
What are the principles in preparing complementary food supplements?
Amylase-Rich Foods (ARFs)
Low-cost food supplements can be prepared at home from commonly used 
ingredients such as cereals (wheat, rice, ragi, jowar, bajra, etc.); pulses (grams/ 
dhals), nuts and oilseeds (groundnut, sesame, etc.), oils (groundnut oil, sesame oil 
etc.) and sugar and jaggery. Such supplements are easily digested by all infants, 
including those with severe malnutrition. The impression that only the commercially 
available supplementary foods are nutritious is not correct. Some examples of low 
cost complementary foods are given on page 33.  
Weaning foods based on cereal-pulse-nut and sugar/ jaggery combinations will 
provide good quality protein, adequate calories and other protective nutrients.  
Since infants cannot consume bulky complementary food, in sufficient quantities, 
energy-rich foods like fats and sugars should be included in such preparations. 
Infants can also be fed green leafy vegetables (GLVs), which are rich, yet 
inexpensive, sources of vitamins and minerals. However, greens should be well 
cleaned before cooking lest the infants develop loose motions. Dietary fibre in green 
leafy vegetables can, by itself, promote the bowel movements leading to loose 
motions in infants. Since GLVs are rich in dietary fibre, it is advisable to initially feed 
only the juice of the GLVs after cooking them properly. Infants should be introduced 
to different vegetables and fruits gradually. It should, however, be remembered that 
these dietary articles should be thoroughly cooked and mashed before feeding. In 
families which can afford egg yolk and meat soup can be introduced.  At about one 
year of age, the child should share the family diet. 
Flours of germinated cereals, which are rich 
in the enzyme alpha-amylase, constitute ARFs. 
Even small amounts of this type of foods liquefy 
and reduce the bulk of the cereal-based diet.  
Thus, ARFs help in increasing the energy 
density of weaning gruels and in reducing its 
bulk as well. 
Mothers can add ARF to increase the 
digestibility of the low-cost weaning foods 
prepared at home. Preparation of ARF is 
very simple and can be done by mothers 
at home.
30
PREPARATION OF AMYLASE RICH FOOD (ARF)
How to feed a young infant?
What are the hygienic practices to be adopted? 
Take 250 g of wheat  
Add 2-3 volumes of water soak it for 8 hrs
Drain excess water  
Germinate wheat in dark for 24-48 hours
Sun dry for 5-8 hours
Roast gently in flat pan just to remove water
Grind and powder the grains (ARF)
Store in airtight bottles/jars
 Add 5 g (one tea spoon) of ARF, after cooking, to every feed 
Infants cannot eat large quantities of food in one sitting at a given time. So, they 
should be fed small quantities at frequent intervals (3-4 times a day). Also, the food 
should be of semi-solid consistency for easy swallowing. When such semi-solid 
foods are offered initially, the infant tends to spit it out. This should not be mistaken as 
dislike for that food. The fact is that the young infant cannot achieve full coordination 
needed for the act of swallowing and hence, brings out the food by movements of its 
tongue. Physiological maturity of swallowing the semi-solid food develops when the 
food is regularly given every day. 
It is important to ensure that hygienic practices are scrupulously followed. All the 
dietary ingredients should be thoroughly cleaned. Vegetables should be washed 
well to remove contaminants/ parasites/ pesticides before cutting. Vegetables 
should preferably be steam-cooked to reduce cooking losses. At the time of 
preparation and feeding of the recipes, mother should observe proper personal 
hygiene and the utensils used for cooking should be thoroughly washed or sterilized, 
31
wherever possible. A number of pre-cooked and ready-to-eat foods can be prepared 
for use as complementary foods (Refer page 33). Such foods should be stored in 
clean bottles or tins. As feeding is likely to be time consuming, the cup or the plate 
from which the recipe is being fed to the infant should be kept covered to protect it 
from flies. Most often, diarrhea is caused by unhygienic practices adopted by 
mothers. The weaning foods which are properly cleaned and well-cooked are safe 
even for young infants.

Breast-milk alone is not enough for infants after 6 months of age. 

Complementary foods should be given after 6 months of age, in addition 
to breast-feeding. 

Do not delay complementary feeding. 

Feed low-cost home-made complementary foods.

Feed complementary food on demand 3-4 times a day. 

Provide fruits and well cooked vegetables.

Observe hygienic practices while preparing and feeding the 
complementary food. 

Read nutrition label on baby foods carefully.

If breast-feeding fails, the infant needs to be fed animal milk or commercial 
infant formula.

Milk should be boiled before being fed to the baby.

To start with, milk may be diluted with an equal volume of water.

Full strength milk may be started from 4 weeks of age.

Infants fed animal milk should receive supplements of iron and vitamin C.

About 120-180 ml of milk should be fed with one teaspoon of sugar per feed, 
6-8 times over the day.

While reconstituting the infant formula, the instructions given on the label 
should be strictly followed.

The feeds should be prepared and given using a sterile cup, spoon, bottles 
and nipples taking utmost care.

Overfeeding should be avoided in artificially-fed infants to prevent obesity.

Low-cost home-made complementary foods should be preferred.

Why do children and adolescents require more food?
Ensure 
adequate 
and 
appropriate 
diets 
for 
children 
and 
adolescents 
both 
in 
health 
and 
sickness
Rationale:
A nutritionally adequate and balanced diet is essential for optimal growth and 
development.

Appropriate diet and physical activity during childhood is essential for optimum 
body composition, BMI and to reduce the risk of diet-related chronic diseases 
in later life and prevent vitamin deficiency. 

Common infections and malnutrition contribute significantly to child morbidity 
and mortality. 

A child needs to eat more during and after episodes of infections to maintain 
good nutritional status. 
Childhood and adolescence are periods of continuous growth and development. 
An infant grows rapidly, doubling its birth weight by 5 months and tripling it by 1 year 
of age. During the second year, the child increases not only in height by 7-8 cm but 
also gains 4 times of its birth weight. During the pre-adolescent period the child 
grows, on an average, 6-7 cm in height and 1.5 to 3 kg in weight every year and 
simultaneously development and maturation of various tissues and organs take 
place (Table 5). 
Adolescent period (teenage) is spread almost over 
a decade. It is characterized by rapid increase in height 
and weight, hormonal changes, sexual maturation and 
wide swings in emotion. Adolescent growth spurt starts 
at about 10-12 years in girls and two years later in boys. 
The annual peak rates for height and weight are 9-10 
cm and 8-10 kg. Development of critical bone mass is 
essential during this period as this forms the ground for 
maintaining mineral integrity of the bone in later life. 
The pattern and proportion of various body components like body water, muscle 
mass, bone and fat increase during the entire childhood and adolescence to reach 
adult values by about 18 years. Adolescent girls are at greater physiological stress 
than boys because of menstruation. Their nutritional needs are of particular 
importance as they have to prepare for motherhood. All these rapid anabolic 
changes require more nutrients per unit body weight.
Well-formulated balanced diets for children and 
adolescents help optimum growth and boosts their immunity

Growing children and adolescents require more calcium. Though recommended 
dietary allowances for calcium are about 600-800 mg/day, it is desirable to give 
higher quantities of calcium for adolescents to achieve high peak bone mass. To 
achieve optimal peak bone mass, it is recommended to consume calcium rich foods 
like milk and milk products, fox tail millet (Ragi), til etc.
Young children below the age of 5 years should be given less bulky foods, rich in 
energy and protein such as legumes, pulses, nuts, edible oil/ghee, sugar, milk and 
eggs. Vegetables including green leafy vegetables and locally available seasonal 
fruits should be part of their daily menu. Snacks make a useful contribution to the 
nutrient requirements, particularly in older children and adolescents. Frequent 
changes in the menu are often liked by children.  
Older children and adolescents should consume plenty of milk to fulfill the high 
calcium requirements. Cooking oils/ghee (25-50g) should be consumed. Over-
indulgence in fats may be avoided. Excessive salt intake should be avoided 
particularly by children having a family history of hypertension. Adolescence is the 
vulnerable stage for developing wrong food habits as well as bad habits like 
smoking, chewing tobacco or drinking alcohol. These should be avoided. In addition 
to consumption of a nutritious well balanced diet, appropriate lifestyle practices and 
involvement in physical activity such as games/sports should be encouraged among 
children and adolescents. Balanced diet for children and adolescents are given in 
annexure 4 and adolescent growth standards are given in annexure 5.
Common childhood infections like diarrhea, measles and pneumonia occur in 
association with malnutrition and contribute to about 70% of mortality. Appropriate 
feeding during infection is essential, which demands a lot of patience from the 
mother.
During periods of infection, children tend to eat less due to reduced appetite.  
Many children vomit frequently. Nutrients are also lost in urine and faeces. The 
unhealthy practice of restricting diet, including breast-feeding, by the mother during 
any sickness could further aggravate the problem.  Hence, extra care is needed in 
feeding the child appropriately during and after illness to prevent subsequent 
nutritional deficiencies. 
Breast-feeds are often well accepted and tolerated even by sick children and 
should be continued except in severe gastroenteritis associated with shock. For 
older children, consuming an adult diet, soft cooked food may be offered at frequent 
intervals. The quantity of the feeds may be increased, after the illness has subsided, 
till the original weight is regained.
How do infections in children lead to malnutrition? 
How should a child be fed during illness? 
35
What should be done during diarrhea?
How important is the problem of lactose intolerance? 
Diarrhea is a common childhood disease which leads to dehydration and 
sometimes death. The child requires prompt correction of fluid and electrolyte loss 
using oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with appropriate/adequate feeding. 
ORS can be prepared by adding a pinch of salt (between thumb and index finger) 
and a teaspoon of sugar to a glass of potable water. Home-made fluids such as rice 
kanji or buttermilk with salt can also be used. During infections, children should 
frequently be given small quantities of fluids by mouth, including plain water.  During 
diarrhea, feeding should be continued, though this goes against the popular 
practice. Breast-milk promotes sodium and water transport across the gut and, thus, 
prevents dehydration and weight loss, in addition to providing other nutrients.  
The diet of 1-2 year old children with diarrhea should provide energy of about 
1000 Kcal/day. Calorie-rich, semi-solid, soft diets may be prepared from a variety of 
cereals and pulses. Sprouted grains are easily digestible and provide good nutrition. 
Fat and sugar help in reducing the bulk of the diets and make them energy dense. 
Milk may be mixed with cereal diet to avoid lactose malabsorption. If milk is not 
tolerated, it may be replaced by an equal volume of curd/yogurt/soymilk. Mashed 
vegetables may be incorporated in the diet. Feeding becomes easier after the 
infection subsides. About 6-8 feeds should be given during the day so that the extra 
food (120-140 Kcal/kg) may be consumed by the child without any difficulty. 
Deficiency of the enzyme lactase leads to lactose intolerance. During acute or 
chronic diarrhea, lactose intolerance is a mild and transient problem. This problem 
can be overcome by reducing the quantity of milk taken at a time or taking milk along 
with a cereal-pulse meal. There is no need to stop milk in acute diarrhoea. In chronic 
diarrhea, some children may develop lactose intolerance. In such children, milk may 
be stopped temporarily. 
A diet based on cereals and pulses or chicken and egg white 
allows the gut to recover and milk can then be slowly introduced. Adequate feeding 
during and after diarrhea prevents malnutrition.
Take extra care in feeding a young child and include soft cooked 
vegetables and seasonal fruits. 

Give plenty of milk and milk products to children and adolescents.

Promote physical activity and appropriate lifestyle practices 

Discourage overeating as well as indiscriminate dieting.

Why should we eat vegetables/fruits?
What functions do these nutrients and special factors in vegetables/fruits
perform in our body?
Eat 
plenty 
of 
vegetables 
and 
fruits
Rationale: 

Normal diet, to be wholesome and tasty, should include fresh vegetables 
and fruits, which are store houses of micronutrients 

Vegetables/fruits are rich sources of micronutrients.

Fruits and vegetables also provide phytonutrients and fibre which are of 
vital health significance

They help in prevention of micronutrient malnutrition and certain chronic 
diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cataract and cancer.  

Fresh fruits are nutritionally superior to fruit juices.
Fresh Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of micronutrients and 
macronutrients (Annexure 15). The micronutrients present are minerals (like iron 
and calcium) and vitamins (like vitamin C, folic acid, B complex vitamins and 
carotenoids) whereas, the macronutrients present are complex carbohydrates/ 
fibre. They contain abundant amounts of iron, calcium, vitamin C, folic acid, 
carotenoids (precursors of vitamin A) and phytochemicals. Some vegetables and 
fruits provide very low calories (Annexure 6), whereas some others such as potato, 
sweet potato, tapioca and yam as well as fruits like banana are rich in starch which 
provides energy in good amount. Therefore, vegetables and fruits can be used to 
increase or decrease calories in our diet.
Iron is an essential element necessary for the formation of haemoglobin, the red 
pigment present in the red cells of blood. Haemoglobin plays an important role in the 
transport of oxygen to the tissues. Reduction in haemoglobin in blood leads to 
anaemia, a condition characterised by paleness and easy fatigue and increased 
susceptibility to infections. Iron is available in plenty in green leafy vegetables. But 
the absorption of iron is limited. Vitamin C rich foods must be consumed daily to 
improve iron absorption. 
Green leafy vegetables, other vegetables and fresh fruits are 
treasure trove of several minerals and vitamins and hence, 
protect from diseases

This fat-soluble vitamin is necessary for clear vision in dim light, and for 
maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues. In vitamin A deficiency, the white of the 
eye (conjunctiva) loses its luster and becomes dry. In severe vitamin A deficiency, 
the black area of the eye (cornea) gets necrosed, leading to irreversible blindness in 
young children. Vitamin A also has a role in maintaining resistance of the body to 
common infections. Carotenoids are plentiful in fruits and vegetables that are green 
or deep yellow/orange in colour, such as green leafy vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, 
sweet potatoes, papaya, mango etc.
Vitamin C is an essential nutrient required for healthy bones and teeth. It also 
promotes iron absorption. Vitamin C deficiency is characterised by weakness,  
bleeding gums and defective bone growth. Vitamin C is abundantly available in 
fresh amla, citrus fruits, guava, banana and certain vegetables such as tomatoes. 
However, it is very susceptible to destruction by atmospheric oxidation. It is for this 
reason that when vegetables become dry and stale or cut and exposed to air most of 
the vitamin C originally present in destroyed.
Folic acid is a haemopoietic vitamin essential for multiplication and maturation of 
red cells in our body. Its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemias. Folic acid 
intake during pregnancy protects the foetus from developing certain congenital 
defects. It also promotes the birth weight of infants. Folic acid deficiency increases 
homocysteine levels in blood, thereby increasing the risk for heart disease. Green 
leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folates. 
Many of the vegetables and fruits have low calories (Annexure 6). Large intake 
of low calorie vegetables and fruits can help in reducing calories in diet and help in 
obesity management. On the other hand vegetables like colocasia, potato, tapioca, 
yam, sweet potato and fruits like banana, avocado pear (215 Kcal) and mahua (111 
Kcal) have more than 100 kcal per 100gram (Annexure 7). 
Vegetables provide phytochemicals and considerable health significance to the 
human body. Among these, dietary fibre, antioxidants and other bio-active 
constituents require special mention. These special factors are required for delaying 
Phytonutrients 
41
ageing and preventing the processes which lead to diseases such as cataract, 
cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. 
Dietary fibre delays the intestinal transit of the food consumed. Dietary fibre is 
important for proper bowel function, to reduce chronic constipation, diverticular 
disease, haemorrhoids coronary heart diseases, diabetes and obesity. They also 
reduce plasma cholesterol. The protective role of dietary fibre against colon cancer 
has long been recognised. 
In the recent past, the role of vegetables and fruits as sources of antioxidants 
has been receiving considerable attention. Antioxidants restrict the damage that 
reactive oxygen free radicals can cause to the cell and cellular components. They 
are of primary biological value in giving protection from certain diseases. Some of 
the diseases that have their origin in deleterious free radical reactions are 
atherosclerosis, cancer, inflammatory joint diseases, asthma, diabetes etc. Raw 
and fresh vegetables like green leafy vegetables, carrots, fresh fruits including citrus 
and tomatoes have been identified as good sources of antioxidants (free radical-
scavengers). The nutrients vitamin C and carotenoids that are present in these 
vegetables are also potential antioxidants. Different colored vegetable provide 
different antioxidants like orange colored provide beta-carotene, red provide 
lycopene, deep red provide betalines, blue and purple provide anthocynins.
The Expert Committee of the Indian Council of 
Medical Research, taking into consideration the 
nutrient requirements, has recommended 
that every individual should consume 
at least 300 g of vegetables (GLV : 50 
g; Other vegetables : 200 g; Roots & 
Tubers : 50 g) in a day. In addition, 
fresh fruits (100 g), should be consumed 
regularly. Since requirements of iron and 
folic acid are higher for pregnant women 
they should consume 100g of leafy 
vegetables daily. High calorie vegetables 
and fruits to be restricted for over weight/ 
obese subjects.

How much should we consume? 
42
Which vegetables and fruits should be consumed?
How to prevent cooking losses ?
How do we get these foods?
How to accommodate more servings of vegetables and fruits in a day?
We should consume fresh, locally available and preferably seasonal vegetables 
and fruits. They have more micronutrients and are tasty. However, no single fruit or 
vegetable provides all the nutrients you need. The key lies in eating a variety of them 
and with different colors. Include commonly consumed leafy greens, tomatoes and 
other vegetables, apart from those which are yellow, orange, red, deep red, purple 
colored citrus fruits, being vitamin C-rich enrich the diets significantly. Along with 
these, try selecting some new vegetables and fruits to your meals.
Vitamins are lost during washing of cut vegetables and cooking of foodstuffs. 
However, proper methods of cooking can substantially reduce these losses. 
Nutrient loss is high when the vegetables are washed after cutting or when they are 
cut into small pieces for cooking. Consumption of properly washed raw and fresh 
vegetables is always beneficial. 
Green leafy vegetables (GLVs), other vegetables and fruits are easily available. 
Most vegetables, particularly GLVs are inexpensive. In fact, these foods can be 
grown in the backyard with very little effort and cost. Even in lean seasons like 
summer, they can be grown using water and waste from kitchen.
To get the maximum nutritional benefits from fruits and vegetables, it is 
important to find ways to eat more servings of vegetables and fruits per day. 
43


Eat as much of other vegetables as possible daily. 

Eat vegetables/ fruits in all your meals in various forms (curry, 
soups, mixed with curd, added to pulse preparations and rice).

Consume raw and fresh vegetables as salads.

Grow the family's requirements of vegetables in the kitchen garden 
if possible.

Green leafy vegetables, when properly cleaned and cooked are
safe even for infants. 

Let different varieties of vegetables and fruits add color to your 
plate and vitality to your life.

Beta-carotene rich foods like dark green, yellow and orange 
colored vegetables and fruits (GLVs, carrots, papaya and mangoes) 
protect from vitamin A deficiency.
Include green leafy vegetables in daily diet.

and 
very

Rationale: 

Fats/oils have high energy value and induce satiety.

Fats provide energy, essential fatty acids and promote absorption of fat-soluble 
vitamins.

Fats are precursors of biologically-active compounds in the body.

Diets that provide excess of calories, fats and cholesterol elevate blood lipids 
(cholesterol and triglycerides) and promote blood clotting.

Excessive fat in the diet increases the risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke and 
cancer.

Ill effects of excess dietary fats are initiated early in life.
Cooking oils (liquid) and solid fats together are referred to as fats. Fats 
contribute to texture, flavor and taste and increase the palatability of the diet. Fats 
are essential for meeting some of the nutritional needs like essential fatty acids 
(linoleic n-6 and alpha-linolenic n-3) and serve as rich sources of energy. Therefore, 
fats should be consumed, in moderation. However, for the growth of young children 
high-calorific diets are required. This is achieved by inclusion of adequate amounts 
of fat (1g fat = 9 Kcals) in their diets as they cannot consume large quantities of bulky 
cereal - pulse- based diets.
Fats also promote the absorption of the four fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E and K), 
impart a feeling of fullness and satisfaction and thus, delay the onset of hunger.
Along with proteins, fats constitute major components of body fluids and cell 
membranes. The two essential fatty acids (EFA) namely, linoleic (LA n-6) and alpha-
linolenic (ALA n-3) acids (important dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids) are 
metabolized at various sites in the body to generate a group of biologically-active 
compounds, which perform several important physiological functions. 
Dietary fats can be derived from plant and animal sources. Fats that are used 
as such at the table or during cooking (vegetable oils, vanaspati, butter and ghee)

are termed as “visible” fats. Fats that are present as an integral components of 
various foods are referred to as “invisible” fat. Fats, in processed and ready to eat 
foods are known as hidden fats. Cereals contain only 2-3% of invisible fat. However, 
their contribution to overall fat intake is significant as they contribute to bulk of our 
Indian diets. The small amounts of invisible fat present in various foods add up to a 
substantial level in our daily diet (about 15 g in rural population and 30g among urban 
middle-income and high-income groups). Most animal foods provide high amounts 
of invisible fat.
The total fat (visible + invisible) in the diet should provide between 20-30% of total 
calories. The visible fat intake in the diets can go upto 50g/person/day based on the 
level of physical activity and physiological status. Adults with sedentary lifestyle 
should consume about 25 g of visible fat, while individuals involved in hard physical 
work require 30 - 40g of visible fat. Visible fat intake should be increased during 
pregnancy and lactation to 30g. The higher fat and EFA requirements during 
pregnancy and lactation are to meet the requirements of fetus and young infants, in 
view of their crucial role in physical and neuronal growth and development. Diets of 
young children and adolescents should contain about 30-50g/day. However, 
ingestion of too much fat is not conducive to good health.
Fatty acids: All fats in foods provide mixtures of three types of fatty acids, which are 
the “building blocks” of fats. Fatty acids are the primary constituents of all dietary 
fats. Based on their chemical nature, the fatty acids are broadly grouped as 
saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA). There are 
several fatty acids in each group. Fats from coconut oil, vanaspati, animal fats (ghee 
and butter) and animal foods like milk, milk products and meat provide saturated 
fatty acids. The short and medium chain saturated fatty acids present in ghee, butter

and coconut oil are easily digested and absorbed and are therefore, good for infants 
and young children. However, high intake of saturated fatty acids increases 
atherogenic risk and their intake should be limited in adults. Oils from sources such 
as palm, groundnut, cottonseed, sesame and olive are rich in monounsaturated 
fattyacids as compared to other oils. Linoleic (n-6) and -linolenic (n-3) acids are the 
simple PUFA, which are present only in plant foods (Table 6). All vegetable oils 
(except coconut) are good sources of linoleic(n-6) acid. Soyabean, rapeseed and 
mustard oils are the only vegetable oils, which contribute significant proportion of a-
linolenic (n-3) acid. Legumes/pulses mustard and fenugreek seeds and green leafy 
vegetables are also good sources of a-linolenic (n-3) acid (Table 7). On the other 
hand, fish and fish oils provide long chain n-3 fatty acids, which are biologically more 
active than alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid present in plant foods. 
Table - 6
Major Types of Fatty Acids in Fats and Oils
Dietary fats also contain minor components such as tocopherols, tocotrienols, 
sterols etc. The natural flavour of fats/oils is largely due to these minor components.  
Since most of the  minor components are antioxidants, they prevent fats from going 
rancid. Tocotrienols in palm oil, lignans in sesame oil and oryzanol and tocotrienols 
in rice-bran oil reduce blood cholesterol. Refining of oils, though does not alter their 
fatty acid composition, modifies the composition of minor components; for example, 
carotenes are lost during refining of crude palm oil.
Cholesterol: Cholesterol is present only in foods of animal origin such as milk, 
meat, shrimp and prawn, but not in plant foods. Vegetable oils do not contain 
cholesterol. Egg yolk, and organ meats such as liver, kidney and brain contain very 
high amounts of cholesterol. Cholesterol is found in all body cells and plays a key 
role in the formation of brain, nerve tissue and is a pre-cursor for some hormones 
and vitamin D. It is synthesized in the body and hence it is not an essential dietary 
component.

Higher dietary cholesterol increases blood cholesterol. The blood cholesterol-
elevating effect of dietary saturated fats increases, when cholesterol consumption is 
high. Therefore, cholesterol intake should be maintained below 200 mg/day. One 
can reduce both saturated fat and cholesterol intake by limiting the consumption of 
high-fat animal foods like butter, ghee, meat, egg and organ meats and consuming 
low fat (skimmed) milk instead of whole milk. However, consumption of eggs (3eggs/ 
week) is recommended in view of several nutritional advantages.
Saturated fatty acids are known to increase serum total and LDL-cholesterol  
levels, reduce insulin sensitivity and enhance thrombogenicity and increase CVD 
risk. Therefore, SFA intake should not exceed 8-10% of total energy. Skimmed milk 
should be preferred instead of whole milk. Restrict consumption of butter and 
cheese. PUFAs are essential components of cell membranes. While n-6 PUFAs are 
predominant in all cells, the nerve tissue has high levels of long chain n-3 PUFA. An 
appropriate balance of the these two classes of PUFAs, namely, linoleic and 
-
linolenic acids in the diets is essential for the functioning of vascular, immune, 
nervous and renal systems and for early human development. PUFAs particularly n-
3 PUFA increase insulin sensitivity, increase peripheral glucose utilization and 
decrease adiposity and hence are anti-atherogenic. n-6 PUFA decrease plasma

cholesterol as well as HDL cholesterol level (only at high intake). The lipid lowering 
and other physiological effects of individual  members  of  the  PUFAs  vary  widely.   
As compared  to  linoleic  acid, alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid is more beneficial for 
prevention of inflammation and accumulation of fatty material in blood vessels 
(altheroscleros) and clotting of blood (thrombosis). The long chain n-3 PUFA of fish 
oils and micro algae have greater antiatherogenic, antithrombotic and anti-
inflammatory effects than alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid of plant foods. They are 
important for vision and brain growth. Therefore, pregnant women should consume 
foods that are rich in 
ALA and long chain n-3 PUFA from fish and fish oils.
The intake of PUFA should be 8-10% of energy intake. The remaining 8-10% of 
fat calories can be derived from mono-unsaturated fatty acids, which also help in 
maintaining plasma cholesterol. Excessive use of highly unsaturated fats should be 
avoided. Further, to get a good proportion of all the classes of fatty acids, it is 
advisable to consume more than one type of vegetable oils.
Fats/ lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol and phospholipids) are transported in 
blood in combination with proteins in the form of  ‘lipoproteins’. The low density 
lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from liver to various tissues. High blood 
levels of LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol) result in accumulation of lipids in the 
cells (atherogenic effect). High density lipoproteins (HDL) ('good' cholesterol) 
transport excess cholesterol from the tissues to the liver for degradation, and are 
therefore, anti-atherogenic. 
In view of the above, an ideal quality fat for good health is the one which 
maintains a balance, so as to give a  ratio  of  polyunsaturated/ saturated (PUFA/ 
SFA) of 0.8-1.0, and linoleic/ a-linolenic (n-6/ n-3) of 5-10 in the total diet. For 
ensuring this appropriate balance of fatty acids in cereal-based diets, it is necessary 
to increase the a-linolenic (n-3) acid intake and reduce  the quantity of linoleic (n-6) 
acid obtained from the cooking oil. Hence, the choice of cooking oil should be as 
follows:
Use of more than one source of fat/oil has the added advantage of providing a 
variety of minor components in the diet. An additional way of increasing alpha-
linolenic (n-3) acid intake is to ensure regular consumption of oils and foods rich in

eating fish, which provides preformed long chain n-3 PUFA. Ideally, part of visible fat 
and/or invisible fat from animal foods may be substituted by whole nuts and legumes 
with good proportion of -linolenic (n-3) acid, which are also good sources of protein, 
fiber, vitamins and minerals (ALA  content of foods is given in annexure 9). 
The plant oils in addition contain certain useful substances such as lignans 
(sesame oil), sterols, tocopherols (vitamin E) oryzanole (rice bran oil), carotenoids - 
all of which reduce cholesterol and reduce oxidant damage due to ageing, 
inflamation which occur in chronic diseases. 
Vanaspati is prepared by hydrogenation of vegetable oils. During hydroge-
nation, the liquid oils become solid because the mono and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids are converted into saturated fatty acids and isomers called trans fatty acids. 
Vanaspati is used as a substitute for ghee in cooking and the preparation of bakery 
products, sweets and snack foods. Since, saturated fats are resistant to oxidation, 
foods prepared in vanaspati keep fresh for a longer period. Current evidence 
indicates that saturated fatty acids and a high intake of trans fatty acids may increase 
the risk of heart disease. Therefore, it is essential to limit the intake of vanaspati.  
The intake of trans fatty acids should not exceed 1% of energy intake.

What is desirable or ideal body weight or Body Mass Index (BMI)? 
What is obesity?  
Avoid 
overeating 
to

overweight 
and 
obesity
Rationale:

A dramatic increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among all the 
age groups has occurred in last 2-3 decades.

About 30-50% of adult Indians are either overweight or obese.

Overweight and obese individuals are at an enhanced risk of co-morbidities 
including type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, gallstones, high blood cholesterol 
and triglycerides, orthopedic disorders (Osteoarthritis), hypertension and 
other cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers and psycho-social problems.

The imbalance between the energy intake and energy out put leads to excess 
accumulation of fat in various parts of the body.
There is no clear definition of a desirable or ideal body weight. Body weight for a 
given height of person with good health and long lifespan is considered as Ideal 
body weight. A much simpler and more acceptable measure is the ratio of weight 
and height, which estimates total body mass and correlates highly with the % of 
body fat. The most commonly used ratio is the BMI. It is computed by dividing the 
weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters [BMI = Weight (kg) ÷ 
2
(Height M) ]. The ideal ranges of weights for a given height are provided by WHO 
(annexure 5), which is useful for categorizing persons as normal (ideal), under-
nourished and overweight or obese. 
Definition of obesity is based on the degree of excess fat. More than a general 
accumulation, the distribution of fat around the abdomen is now considered to be 
more harmful than fat around the hips. Accumulation of fat around abdomen 
indicated by higher waist circumference is considered as risk factor. In general, BMI 
ranging from 18.5 to 25 is considered to be normal. However, for Asians it is 
recommended that the BMI should be between 18.5 and 23, since, they tend to have 
higher percentage body fat even at lower BMI compared to Caucasians and 
Europeans, which puts them at higher risk of chronic non-communicable diseases. 
O

disease, diabetes and certain types of cancers

=5  and <85  centiles are normal, and 
th
th
th
with =85  and <95  centile are considered as overweight. More than 95  centile are 
considered as obese. 
The waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratios are useful for estimation of 
central and truncal obesity respectively. Several studies have shown that the central 
obesity was directly correlated with chronic degenerative diseases especially 
metabolic syndrome. Waist-to-hip ratio of more than 0.9 among men and 0.8 in 
women and waist circumference 90cm for men and 80cm for women are associated 
with  increased risk of several chronic diseases especially in 
Asian Indians. 
There are several health consequences of obesity. Excessive body weight 
increases the risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, gallstones, certain types 
of cancers and osteoarthritis. Obesity invariably predisposes to reduced levels of 
high density lipoproteins ('good' cholesterol) and to increased levels of low density 
lipoproteins ('bad' cholesterol), and triglycerides, besides an abnormal increase in 
glucose and insulin levels in blood. Considering the increasing trend in the 
prevalence of coronary artery disease, hypertension and diabetes in India, it is 
important to maintain desirable body weight for height and avoid obesity. 
Over-feeding during infancy, childhood and adolescence predisposes to 
overweight/ obesity during adulthood. The tendency of familial obesity seems to be 
inherited. Eating junk or unhealthy foods 
coupled with low physical activity is 
considered as a main contributor. 
Complex behavioral and psychological 
factors influence the eating patterns. In 
addition, metabolic errors in energy 
utilization may favor fat accumulation.

What causes obesity ?

(<2500 g and >3500g), obesity during childhood and adolescence are likely to lead 
to obesity in adults. It is therefore, necessary to maintain a desirable body weight by 
consuming just enough calories or adjust physical activity to maintain energy 
balance (intake = output). Body weight must, therefore, be checked and monitored 
periodically. 
Several studies have suggested that hours spent in watching television is 
strongly associated with weight gain in childhood and adolescents, mostly due to the 
sedentary behavior, tendency to consume snack foods while watching television 
and influence of the advertisements of energy dense foods.
Adults usually tend to gain weight between the ages of 25-50 years. In women, 
obesity develops just around pregnancy and after menopause. 
There is no single regimen for weight reduction; it has to be individualized. 
Weight reduction should be gradual. Weight reduction diets should not be less than 
1000 Kcal/day and provide all nutrients. A reduction of half a kilogram body weight 
per week is considered to be safe. Extreme approaches should be avoided and use 
of drugs may be dangerous. In children, obesity should be controlled by increasing 
physical activity rather than restricting food intake. Modifications in dietary habits 
have to be incorporated into one's lifestyle along with adequate exercise to keep the 
body weight within the normal limits. 
As fat contains more than twice the calories (9Kcal) per gram compared to 
protein (4Kcal) and carbohydrate (4Kcal), weight reducing diets should limit the fat 
intake. Refined sugars (4Kcal) and alcohol (7Kcal) provide empty calories and 
should be avoided. Refined carbohydrates which promote fast absorption of 
glucose (Glycemic carbohydrates) also need to be restricted (Annexure 10). Plant 
foods that provide complex carbohydrates and fibre may be preferred as they 
reduce blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Weight- reducing diets must be 
rich in proteins and low in carbohydrates and fats. Consumption of plenty of fruits 
and vegetables would not only result in satiety but could also help to maintain 
adequate micronutrient intake. Frequent fasting/ semi-fasting (cyclic weight 
reduction) followed by adequate or excess food consumption will also aggravate the 
problem of weight gain. 
All reducing regimens should be monitored by a doctor and a 
dietitian.

Physical activity is essential to maintain ideal body weight by burning excess 
calories and is of vital significance for health and prevention of non-

It is recommended to carry out at least 45 minutes of physical activity of 
moderate-intensity for at least 5 days in a week. This amount of physical activity may 
reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. To lose weight, experts recommend that at 
least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity be taken on 
most days of the week. In addition, one should follow a nutritious eating plan and 
consume fewer calories. Therefore, it is essential to remember that the body weight

is affected by the balance of “calories-consumed” and “calories-burned.” Those, 
who are on low calorie diets for body weight reduction should have moderate to 
vigorous intensity physical activities at least for 60-90 minutes daily. Physical activity 
is essential for successful long-term weight management and will depend on current 
BMI and health condition (Annexure 11).
There are two basic levels of physical activity.
This includes walking briskly (about 5-6 KM in an hour), climbing, 
gardening/yard work, dancing, walking short distances for fetching milk and 
vegetables, bicycling (about 16 KM in an hour), and weight training (a general light 
workout), yogasanas and pranayama, playing with children.
Examples are running/jogging (7 KM in an hour), cycling (> 16 KM in an 
hour), swimming (freestyle laps), aerobics, brisk walking (6 KM in an hour), weight 
lifting (vigorous effort), competitive sports and heavy yard work, such as digging, 
cutting wood.
The approximate energy costs of various physical activities in different 
intensities for a 60 kg person are given in annexure-11. 
If a physical activity does not increase the heart rate, it is not intense enough to be 
counted in the category of “45 minutes of exercise a day”. Activities that do not 
increase the heart rate include walking at a casual pace, grocery shopping, and 
doing light household chores.
These activities are very beneficial to health.
These speed your heart rate and breathing while improving heart and lung 
fitness. Examples: brisk walking, jogging and swimming.
These help build and maintain bones and muscles by working them against 
gravity. Lifting weights, walking with child in arms are a few examples.
Dancing, gentle stretching, yoga, martial arts and Tai chi reduce risk of injuries 
by improving physical stability and flexibility.

Sources of sodium
Restrict 
salt 
intake 
to 
minimum
Rationale: 


Sodium plays an important role in nerve conduction and fluid balance in the 
body. 

Maintenance of sodium balance depends on kidney function. 

High intake of salt (sodium chloride) is associated with high blood pressure 
and stomach cancer.  

All foods contain sodium. Sodium requirements can be met with moderate 
salt intake.

Sodium intake needs to be balanced by potassium intake.
Salt is an essential ingredient of food and enhances its taste. From time 
immemorial, it has been used as a preservative. 
All food substances contain sodium, 
but added salt (sodium 40%, chloride 60%) is the major source of sodium in our diet. 
Sodium is primarily involved in the maintenance of water balance and equilibrium. It 
also plays an important role in electro-physiological functions of the cell. Humans 
have powerful in-built mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure even on minimal 
sodium intake.  
Sodium is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and a positive balance 
is achieved on intakes just above minimal requirements. Sodium requirements 
depend on its losses through urine, faeces and sweat. The sweat loss varies 
according to climatic conditions. High ambient temperatures and vigorous physical 
exercise increase sodium loss through sweat. Even after 6 hours of hard physical 
labor, which may generate 3 litres of sweat, the requirement of sodium chloride may 
not be more than 6 g/day.   
Natural diets, in general, provide about 300-400 mg of sodium a day. Cereals, 
pulses, vegetables, milk, animal and sea foods are the major sources of sodium. 
Indian data indicate that per capita consumption of salt ranges from less than 5g to 
30g/day in different States with almost 40% of population consuming about 10g/day. 
Increased salt intake may pose health risk and may lead to 
hypertension and heart disease
Sodium is the major electrolyte in the extra-cellular fluid. 
61
Since, the taste for salt is acquired, its consumption could be restricted right from an 
early age.
Preserved foods such as pickles, sun dried foods such as papads, sauces/ ketch 
up and canned foods contribute to higher intakes of salt. 
There is a strong association between salt intake and blood pressure. 
Prevalence of hypertension is low in populations consuming less than 3 g salt per 
day. The usual increase in blood pressure with age is also not seen with such 
intakes. The amount of salt consumed is reflected in urinary sodium. Drastic 
restriction of dietary salt decreases the risk of hypertension. However, this effect is 
not uniform as only 20-30% of population is salt sensitive. Potassium-rich foods 
such as fresh vegetables and fruits decrease blood pressure. In fact, it is the ratio of 
sodium to potassium in the diet which is important. Salt intake higher than 8 g/day is 
considered as a risk factor for hypertension.  
Besides increasing blood pressure, excessive salt may also affect stomach 
mucosa and result in atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer.  
Higher sodium intake leads to greater calcium excretion which may result in 
reduction in bone density. Existing evidence reveals a deleterious impact of high salt 
intake on blood vessels, blood pressure, bones and gastrointestinal tract. Salt intake 
in our population generally exceeds the requirement. It should not be more than 6 g 
per day. Salt is used as a vehicle for food fortification since, it is commonly used in 
food preparation.
What are the health problems associated with excessive salt/sodium intake?
62

Restrict the intake of added salt right from an early age.

Develop a taste for foods/diets that are low in salt.

Ensure 
the 
use 
of 
safe 
and 
clean 
foods
Rationale:

Safe and good-quality foods are  essential for maintaining good health 

Naturally-occurring toxins, environmental contaminants and adulterants in 
foods constitute a health hazard. 

Consumption of unsafe foods can lead to food-borne diseases.  
Microbes (bacteria and moulds) and their products are responsible for food 
spoilage. Natural enzymes present in food also lead to its deterioration. Besides, 
insects, rodents, adulterants, natural toxins and various chemical residues beyond 
permissible levels, make the food unwholesome. In addition to moisture and 
environmental conditions like temperature, storage time also influence the quality of 
the food. 
Selection of the right food is the first step to ensure safe and good quality diet. 
Food items purchased from reliable sources having a high turnover ensure their 
freshness. Some foods carry certification mark assuring good quality. For example 
AGMARK for honey and ghee; FPO (Fruit Products Order) for fruit and vegetable 
products (jams, squashes, etc); ISI (Bureau of Indian Standards) for food colours 
and essences. While purchasing packaged food always look for ‘best before’ or 
‘date of expiry’.
Food grains purchased should be free from infestation and foreign matter   
(rodent excreta and insect remains). They should be of uniform size and should not 
be shrivelled, shrunken or mouldy. Foodstuffs should be free from artificial colors. 
There is a risk of adulteration when fats/oils are purchased loose from unsealed 
containers. Therefore, it is always safer to purchase reputed brand products in 
sealed sachets/containers. It is necessary to buy pasteurized milk in sachets from a 
reputed dairy or a reliable vendor to avoid the risk of adulteration and contamination. 
Milk products such as butter, ghee and khoa should also be purchased from reliable 
sources. Whole spices, uniform in color, size and shape should be preferred. Since 
powdered spices are more likely to be adulterated, always buy certified products. 
Fruits and vegetables that show patches, physical damage with bruises or wilted

and decayed with visible evidence of insects and moulds, should be avoided. Eggs 
should be fresh and free from cracks. Meat or poultry must be examined for 
characteristic color, odor and texture and should be purchased fresh or frozen. 
Freshness of fresh-water fish is indicated by a stiff body, bright, clear and bulging 
eyes, reddish gills, tight scales and absence of stale odor or discoloration. Fresh fish 
will not show any pitting on finger pressure.
Agricultural commodities should be dried and adequately in a safe storage 
structure, to protect them from moisture and to prevent the damage from microbs 
like bacteria and mould producing toxins (eg. aflatoxins). Rodent attacks, and the 
presence of insects and microbes, not only reduce the availability of nutrients but 
render the foods harmful. Frequent and careful disinfestation of the storage 
premises using rodenticides like aluminium phosphide is essential. Some traditional  
household practices such as application of edible oils to grains, placing dried neem 
leaves in storage bins etc., are known to prevent infestations. 
Foodborne infections and toxicities are common particularly  with consumption 
of susceptible foods such as milk products like khoa, meat, poultry and even cooked 
foods like rice. Improper processing, handling and cooking, and keeping cooked 
foods in warm conditions for several hours before eating, promote bacterial growth 
and toxin production.
Perishable foods like milk, meat, vegetables and cooked foods, are prone to 
spoilage due to microbes. These foods should be stored under refrigeration, 
o
preferably at a temperature of 10 c or less, which retards multiplication of 
microorganisms. However, even refrigerated foods, if stored for long, can get spoilt. 
Cross contamination can be avoided by keeping cooked and raw foods separately. 
In case of food which is cooked, if not consumed immediately has to be stored for 
o
some time, it should be kept either hot (more than 60 c) or be cooled quickly (below 
o
o
10 c). Most micro-organisms multiply at temperatures between 10 and 60 c.  
Refrigerated cooked food should be heated before consumption. However, 
repeated heating may be avoided.  
Food handlers should observe good personal hygiene to maintain food safety.  
They should be free from obvious signs of illness, wounds and sores. Traditionally in

India, cooked food is touched by bare hands while preparing, serving and eating. 
Use of spoons and ladles should be encouraged to avoid contamination. Hands 
should be washed thoroughly with soap before starting the preparation of food and 
after every interruption. Household pets like cats and dogs often harbour dangerous 
pathogens. They should be kept away from places where food is cooked, stored or 
served. 
Foods may be adulterated with non-food material or inferior quality product. 
Spoilt, stale or poor quality food is made attractive and fresh by adding harmful 
colors or other chemicals. Frequently adulterated food items are milk and milk 
products, cereals, pulses and their products, edible oils and spices. The different 
classes of adulterants include non-permitted colors like metanil yellow; non-edible 
oils like castor oil; cheaper agricultural produce like various starches in milk powder; 
extraneous matter like husk, sand and sawdust; and metal contaminants like 
aluminum or iron filings. Consumption of adulterated foods could lead to disease 
outbreaks of epidemic proportions. Buying from a reliable and reputed source, 
careful checking of foods before purchase and insisting on certified brands will all 
minimize the risk of food adulteration.  
Pesticides, used during cultivation of crops, can 
remain as residues in foodstuffs, especially vegetables 
and fruits. Exposure of the population to pesticide 
residues may be harmful and can be minimized by 
washing the foodstuffs thoroughly in running water 
or by peeling. Cooking and other processes can 
also reduce such residues (Annexure 12). 
Insect control operations such as disinfestation 
in the kitchen by spraying pesticides is another 
source of contamination. Utmost care should be 
taken to ensure that eatables are well covered and 
protected from exposure to such harmful agents.

Rationale: 
 

Cultural factors play an important role in dietary practices.

Faulty food fads and beliefs adversely affect nutrition and health. 

Cooking renders food palatable and helps in easy digestion. 

Cooking destroys harmful germs. 

Faulty pre-cooking and cooking process lead to loss of nutrients. 

Cooking at high temperatures leads to destruction of nutrients and 
formation of harmful substances.
Food habits are formed early in childhood, passed on from the elders in the 
family and perpetuated to adulthood. Food beliefs either encourage or discourage 
the consumption of particular type of foods. There can be neutral, harmless or 
harmful practices. Unfortunately, most of the food fads and prejudices (taboos) are 
associated with women and children, who are also the most vulnerable to 
malnutrition. Exaggerated beneficial or harmful claims in respect of some foods, 
without scientific basis constitute food fads. In addition, the belief of heat producing 
and cold inducing foods is widely prevalent. Some examples are jaggery, sugar, 
groundnuts, fried foods, mango, bajra, jowar, maize, eggs and meat. Papaya fruit is 
strongly suspected to lead to abortion, though there is no scientific basis. Buttermilk, 
curd, milk, green gram dhal, green leafy vegetables, ragi, barley flour and apples 
are considered as cold inducing foods which are actually nutritious. Vegetarianism 
is often practiced in India on religious grounds. Since vitamin B  is present only in 
12
foods of animal origin, vegetarians should ensure an adequate consumption of milk. 
During certain illnesses like measles and diarrhea, dietary restriction is practiced. 
This can aggravate malnutrition in young children.
Foods, in their natural state, contain different nutrients in varying amounts.  
Cooking improves the digestibility of most foods. Flesh foods get softened on 
cooking and become easily chewable. Proper methods of cooking render foods

palatable by improving the appearance, taste, flavor and texture, thereby enhancing 
acceptability. In addition, they help in destroying disease causing organisms and 
eliminating natural inhibitors of digestion. In the course of food preparation, 
depending on the recipe, foods are subjected to various processes such as 
washing, grinding, cutting, fermentation, germination and cooking. In the Indian 
cuisine, fermentation (idli, dosa, dhokla) and germination (sprouting) are common 
practices. These  methods  improve  digestibility  and  increase  nutrients  such  as 
B-complex vitamins and vitamin C. 
Foods should be washed well before cooking and consumption to remove 
contaminants like pesticide residues, parasites and other extraneous material 
(Annexure 12). However, certain precautions need to be taken while washing and 
cutting to minimize the loss of nutrients. Repeated washing of food grains like rice 
and pulses results in losses of certain minerals and vitamins. Vegetables and fruits 
should be washed thoroughly with potable water before cutting. Cutting of 
vegetables in to small pieces exposes a greater surface area of the foodstuff to the 
atmosphere, resulting in loss of vitamins due to oxidation. Therefore, vegetables 
should be cut in to large pieces. Cut vegetables should not be soaked in water for 
long, as water-soluble minerals and vitamins get dissolved. 
There are many methods of cooking like boiling, steaming, pressure cooking, 
frying, roasting and baking. Boiling is the most common method of cooking, during 
which heat-labile and water-soluble vitamins like vitamin B-complex and C is lost. 
The practice of using excess water while cooking rice should be discouraged since it 
leads to loss of vitamins; just sufficient water to be fully absorbed should be used. 
Use of baking soda for hastening cooking of pulses 
should not be practiced, as it results in loss of 
vitamins. Frying involves cooking food 
in oil/ghee/vanaspati at high 
temperatures. Shallow frying 
involves use of much smaller 
amounts of oils than deep frying. 
Repeated heating of oils 
particularly PUFA-rich oils 
results in formation of 
peroxides and free radicals 
and, hence, should be avoided

by using just enough oil. Similarly, oils which have been repeatedly heated should 
not be mixed with fresh oil but should be used for process such as seasoning. 
Microwave cooking is convenient, fast and preserves nutrients and also useful 
in reheating of food. But it can reheat or cook unevenly and leave some cold spots in 
the food by which harmful bacteria can enter into our body. So it is discouraged to 
use large amounts or big pieces in the microwave oven otherwise mix the food in 
between for even heating or cooking. Never use partially heated food. Don't cook 
frozen food in the microwave oven directly as it leaves some parts of the food 
partially cooked. 
Always use glass or pottery dishes and food grade microwave friendly plastic 
dishes and wrap to re-heat foods. Approximate calorific value of some cooked food

Beverages are useful to relieve thirst and to meet fluid requirements of the 
body. 

Some beverages provide nutrients while others act as stimulants. 

Milk is an excellent beverage for all age groups as it is a rich source of 
nutrients.  
Water accounts for 70% of our body weight. It is a constituent of blood and other 
vital body fluids. Water plays a key role in elimination of body wastes and regulation 
of body temperature. The body loses water through sweat, urine and faeces. This 
loss must be constantly made good with clean and potable water. A normal healthy 
person needs to drink about 8 glasses (2 litre) of water per day. During very hot 
weather and while undertaking vigorous physical activity, this requirement increases 
as a considerable amount of water is lost through sweat.  
Water should be safe and wholesome i.e., it should be free from disease-causing 
agents like bacteria, viruses, parasites etc., and harmful chemical substances like 
pesticides, industrial wastes, heavy metals, nitrates, arsenic and excess of fluoride. 
Fluorosis, a disease with bone deformities and dental problems, results from

concentration of 0.5 to 0.8 mg of fluoride per litre of drinking water is considered safe.
If a water source is not safe for drinking, boiling it for 10-15 minutes is a 
satisfactory method of purification of the water. It kills all disease-causing organisms 
and also removes temporary hardness. However, boiling will not remove other 
chemical impurities. Tablets containing 0.5g of chlorine can disinfect 20 litres of water. 
There are many modern gadgets which claim to provide safe and wholesome water. 
However,  they  vary  in  efficacy.Drinking water standards given in annexure-13.
Water is the most important nutrient of all and helps in the 
upkeep of our health

How nutritious is milk ?
What is lactose intolerance ?
What are soft drinks ?
Milk is a well accepted and wholesome food and beverage for all age groups. It 
contains most of the nutrients necessary for growth and development. It is, 
therefore, specially useful or feeding infants, toddlers, growing children and 
expectant women and nursing mothers. All the macro and micro-nutrients are 
present in an easily digestible and assimilable form in milk. Milk proteins possess 
high biological value which is almost equal to that of meat, eggs and other high-
quality animal proteins. Milk proteins are valuable supplements to most vegetarian 
diets. 
Milk is a rich source of bioavailable calcium which helps in the building up of 
strong bones. Milk fat serves as a vehicle for important fat-soluble vitamins A, D and 
E. Since, milk fat is of the saturated type those who have to be on a low fat diet can  
consume skimmed/toned milk. For strict vegetarians, milk is the only source of 
vitamin B . Milk is also rich in riboflavin, but is a poor source of vitamins C and iron. 
12
However, only pasteurized or boiled milk should be consumed to ensure protection 
from disease-causing agents.
Lactose, the sugar present in milk, helps in the establishment of lactic acid 
bacteria in the intestinal tract. If lactase, an enzyme required for digestion of lactose, 
is not present in sufficient amounts, such individuals develop abdominal symptoms 
on consumption of excess of milk. This is common in children following diarrhea and 
is described as lactose intolerance. Drinking small quantities of milk at a time does 
not usually cause any gastrointestinal problems and there is no need to discourage 
intake of milk by children except in severe cases of diarrhea. 
Soft drinks are generally of two categories, natural soft drinks and artificial or 
synthetic soft drinks. Water is the main constituent of all beverages. Orange, lemon, 
grape, mango, pineapple and apple are generally used in making fruit juice. sugar 
cane juice is also extensively used in India, particularly during summer. Natural fruit 
juices provide in addition to energy, some vitamins (beta-carotenes, vitamin C) and 
minerals (potassium, calcium). Fruit juices being potassium rich are ideal 
beverages for those suffering from hypertension. However, they cannot be equated 
with fruits which also provide dietary fibre. 
Compared to natural fruit juices, synthetic drinks do not contain nutrients unless 
they are fortified. Generally, synthetic drinks are prepared using preservatives, 
artificial colors and flavors such as cola, orange, mango and lime, and mostly they 
72
are carbonated. Carbonated beverages  contain phosphoric acid 
and may damage the enamel of teeth, and affect appetite if taken 
in excessive  amounts.  Water used for preparation of beverages 
should be free from disease-causing agents and harmful 
chemical impurities. 
Beverages like buttermilk, lassi, fruit 
juices and coconut water are better 
alternatives to synthetic drinks.
Tea and coffee are popular beverages. 
They are known to relieve mental and muscular fatigue. This characteristic 
stimulating effect is due to their caffeine content. A cup (150 ml) of brewed coffee 
contains 80-120 mg of caffeine and instant coffee 50-65 mg, while tea contains 30-
65 mg of caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and induces 
physiological dependence. 
Generally, low doses (20-200 mg) of caffeine produce mild positive effects like a 
feeling of well-being, alertness and being energetic. Higher doses (>200 mg) can 
produce negative effects like nervousness and anxiety, especially in people who do 
not usually consume caffeine-containing beverages. Therefore, moderation in tea 
and coffee consumption is advised so that caffeine intake does not exceed the 
tolerable limits. Tannin is also present in tea and coffee and is known to interfere with 
iron absorption. Hence, tea and coffee should be avoided at least for one hour before 
and after meals.    
Excess consumption of coffee is known to increase blood pressure and cause 
abnormalities in heart beat. In addition, an association between coffee consumption 
and elevated levels of total and LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), triglycerides and 
heart disease has been demonstrated. Therefore, individuals with heart disease 
need to restrict coffee consumption. Also, those who experience adverse effects 
from caffeine should stop drinking coffee.  
Besides caffeine, tea contains theobromine and theophylline. These are known 
to relax coronary arteries and thereby promote circulation. Tea also contains 
flavonoids and other antioxidant polyphenols, which are known to reduce the risk for 
coronary heart disease and stomach cancer. However, as a result of its caffeine 
content, excess tea consumption is deleterious to health. Decaffeinated coffee and 
tea are being marketed to obviate the adverse effects of caffeine. 
What about tea and coffee ?

Tender coconut water
Alcohol
Tender coconut water is a nutritious beverage. It has a caloric 
value of 17.4 per 100 gm. The concentration of sugar steadily 
increases from 1.5% to about 5.5% in the early months of maturation 
and this slowly falls to about 2% at the stage of full maturity. 
Tender coconut water contains most of the minerals such as 
potassium (290 mg%), Sodium (42 mg%), Calcium (44 
mg%), magnesium (10 mg%), Phosphorus (9.2 mg%), 
iron (106 mg%),and copper (26 mg%). It is an oral 
rehydration medium and keeps the body cool. However, in 
patients with hyper kalemia such as renal failure, acute 
adrenal insufficiency and in patients with low urine output, TCW should be avoided.
Alcoholic beverages contain ethyl alcohol in varying proportions. Beer contains 
2-5% and wine 8-10% of alcohol, while brandy, rum and whisky contain much higher 
concentrations (30-40%). Alcohol has been extensively abused as an appetite 
stimulant and as a sedative-hypnotic drug. Alcohol intake, which is initiated as an 
innocent social habit may gradually result in a serious addiction. It may lead to 
several serious psycho-social problems and accidents.  
Alcohol provides higher calories (7 Kcal/g) than 
carbohydrates and proteins and thus, can contribute 
to obesity. Ironically, excessive intake of alcohol is 
known to suppress appetite and interfere with 
absorption and metabolism of nutrients, leading to 
various nutritional deficiency diseases.  
Excessive intake of alcohol suppresses appetite 
and as a result, leads to several nutritional deficiency 
diseases. People who regularly consume more than 
two alcoholic drinks (one equals about 30 ml of 
ethanol) are at a higher risk for hypertension and stroke. Alcohol intake has also 
been shown to increase the risk of cancer of the mouth, larynx and oesophagus, 
prostate and of the breast in women. Excessive alcohol intake weakens the heart 
muscle (cardiomyopathy) and also damages the liver (cirrhosis), brain and 
peripheral nerves. It also increases serum triglycerides.

What are processed foods?
Do we need processed foods?
Minimize 
the 
use 
of 
processed 
foods 
rich 
in 
salt, 
sugar 
and 
fats
Rationale:

Urbanization has increased the intake and demand for processed foods. 

There is a trend towards replacing traditionally cooked foods with processed 
foods. 

Processed foods may not be nutritionally balanced unless fortified.

Sugar, a processed food, provides empty calories.
Foods that are subjected to technological 
modifications either for preservation or for converting 
into ready-to-use/eat foods, eliminating laborious 
household procedures, are called “processed foods”. 
Some of the examples are ready mixes, dehydrated 
foods, pasta products, canned foods, 
confectioneries, bakery, dairy products 
and breakfast foods. Manufacture of 
processed foods requires technology 
application and machinery, and as a 
result, processed foods are expensive. 
 
There is an increased demand for processed, ready-to-eat and convenience 
foods due to changes in lifestyle. As more and more women go to work outside, and 
families have become nuclear, consumption of processed foods, particularly in 
urban areas, will be on the increase. Today's consumer is looking for convenient, 
easy-to-cook, and ready-to-eat foods which require less time to prepare than 
traditional home-cooked foods. Food processing is must to preserve highly 
perishable products like milk, meat, fish and fresh fruits and vegetables. Food 
processing increases the seasonal availability of foods and enables easy 
transportation and distribution over long distances.
Processed foods being rich in fats, salt, sugar and preserva-
tives may pose a health risk if consumed regularly
76
Do processed foods contribute to nutrient intake?
What is the difference between instant foods, fast foods, street foods and 
unhealthy (junk) foods?
Processed foods are generally consumed either as part of a meal, or as a snack 
item. Their contribution in terms of essential nutrients depends on the type of 
processing and fortification, the frequency of use, and the quantity consumed.  
Processed foods are generally refined and a majority of them are rich in fat or in 
salt/sugar, and are calorie dense. They lack dietary fibre and micronutrients. Thus, 
caution needs to be  exercised when processed foods constitute a major part of the  
meal. 
Breakfast cereals are increasingly being used in urban areas. Traditional 
breakfast items like idli, dosa, upma and roti are rich sources of nutrients. Puffed and 
parched rice products (eg. flaked rice) besides being crisp and tasty, are easily 
digestible. Food items like chips, candies, peppermints, chocolates, etc., which are 
popular among children, are considered as unhealthy since, they provide only  
empty calories often containing artificial colors and other additives. Their use should 
be discouraged.
Instant foods are those, which undergo special processing designed to dissolve or 
to disperse particles more rapidly in a liquid than the untreated product. For instance, 
instant noodles, soup powders, cornflakes fall under this category. Although all 
instant foods need not be unhealthy in terms of high calorie or salt contents, there are 
concerns about the presence of certain additives like monosodium glutamate, which 
may also add up to the over-all sodium intake from the foods. 
Fast foods are foods already made or cooked to order within minutes for 
consumption like noodles, burgers, fried fish, milk shakes, chips, salads, pizzas, 
sandwiches, etc. Storage, handling and microbiological contamination are the major 
concerns. Further they are calorie dense foods.
Street foods comprises of a wide range of ready-to-eat foods and beverages 
prepared and/or sold by vendors and hawkers, especially on streets and other public 
places. Idly, Wada, Dosa, Chat Items etc are examples of street foods. They may be 
contaminated with pathogenic organisms unless hygienically prepared.

Unhealthy (Junk) Foods
Unhealthy foods are those containing little or no proteins, vitamins or minerals but 
are rich in salt, sugar, fats and are high in energy (calories). Some examples are 
chocolates, artificially flavored aerated drinks, potato chips, ice creams, french fries 
etc.
Frequent consumption of unhealthy processed food increases calorie intake 
without providing any nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Apart from being non-
nutritious, processed foods also contain food additives. Food additives consumed 
beyond permissible limits may have adverse effects on health. The national food 
regulatory authorities periodically review these limits. Thus, consumption of 
processed foods may not only affect intake of nutrients, but in addition, increase the 
risk of exposure to various chemical additives. 
In the coming years, with larger constraints on time at home, demand for 
processed foods is certain to increase. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that 
intake of a nutritionally balanced diet is not compromised with unwise intake of 
various processed and convenience foods. Processed vegetables and fruits 
available in the market are no match to nutrient rich fresh vegetables and fruits.
Sugars occur both naturally and as an ingredient in many foods. They are present 
in natural foods like fruits, vegetables, milk and honey. Added sugars provide taste 
and texture to foods. Sugar is present in processed foods like chocolates, jams, ice-
creams and soft drinks. The most familiar sugar is sucrose. Refined or table sugar 
(sucrose) provides “empty calories”. Foods such as cakes, pastries, confectionery 
and sweets often have high amounts of fat, and sugar, and are prepared with refined 
cereals. Excess consumption of sugary foods may lead to obesity and elevated 
blood lipids. Children overindulging in chocolates and candies are prone to dental 
carries. For prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, sugars and refined cereals 
should be sparingly used. 
Why should we restrict intake of unhealthy processed foods?
Why should we moderate intake of sugar ?
78

Prefer traditional, home made foods. 
Avoid replacing meals with snack foods.  

Limit consumption of sugar and unhealthy processed foods which 
provide only (empty) calories. 

Prefer fortified processed foods.

Always read food labels (given on containers) regarding content of 
nutrients, shelf-life and the additives present.

Who is an elderly person?
How are the elderly different?
Include 
micronutrient 
rich 
foods 
in 
the 
diets 
of 
elderly 
people 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
be 
fit 
and 
active
Rationale:

Body composition changes with advancing age, and these changes affect 
nutritional needs of the elderly.

Elderly or aged people require reduced amounts of calories, as their lean 
muscle mass and physical activity decrease with ageing.   

Elderly are more prone to diseases due to lowered food intake, physical activity 
and resistance to infection. 

Good /healthy food habits and regular comfortable level of physical activity are 
required to minimise the ill effects of ageing and to improve the quality of life. 

Elderly need adequate amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, 
minerals and dietary fibre. 

Elderly need more calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A and antioxidants to prevent 
age-related degenerative diseases and for healthy ageing. 
Individuals of 60 years and above (WHO) constitute the elderly. In India, the 
elderly constitute about 7 percent of the total population (Census, 2001) and by 2016 
and by they are likely to increase to 10 percent.  
Ageing affects almost all the systems of the body, and is associated 
with several physiological, metabolic and psychological changes. The 
changes incude decline in physical activity, digestion, metabolism, bone 
mass and muscle mass. Failing eye-sight and impaired hearing may also 
occur. Low appetite as a result of loss of taste and smell perception, 
dental problems, atrophic changes in GIT, constipation and decreased 
physical activity could lead to overall decrease of food intake and poor 
absorption of nutrients. Inability to prepare food, economic dependency 
and other psycho-social problems adversely affects the health and 
nutritional status of the elderly.
There is a decline in immune function with advancing age, which leads to 
decreased resistance to infectious diseases. The increased parathyroid 
Senior citizens need more of vitamins and minerals to

80
hormone (PTH) secretion in the elderly leads to increased bone turn over i.e. 
osteoporosis. Similarly, elderly individuals are at increased risk of osteomalacia i.e. 
defective bone mineralization due to lack of exposure to sunlight and poor diet.
In general, majority of the health problems among the elderly are nutrition related. 
Consumption of nutritious foods rich in micronutrients including antioxidant vitamins 
& minerals and fibre, comfortable level of physical activity would enable the elderly to 
live active and meaningful healthy lives, without being a burden on society and their 
family members. Uncomplicated ageing can also be quite productive, say in the 
domestic sphere. 
Resistance to disease declines in the elderly. The common ailments in the elderly 
are degenerative diseases such as arthritis (joint diseases), osteoporosis, 
osteomalacia, cataract, diabetes, cardiovascular (stroke, heart diseases) problems, 
neurological (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's) and psychiatric (dementia, depression, 
delirium) disorders and cancer.  Besides these, the prevalence of respiratory, gastro 
intestinal tract (GIT) and urinary tract infections is common among the elderly. 
As people grow older, they tend to become physiologically less active and 
therefore need fewer calories to maintain their weights. The daily intake of oil should 
not exceed 20 g. Use of ghee, butter, vanaspati and coconut oil should be avoided. 
They need foods rich in protein such as pulses, toned milk, egg-white etc. The 
elderly population is prone to various nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, the elderly 
need nutrient-rich foods rich in calcium, micro-nutrients and fibre. Apart from cereals 
and pulses, they need daily at least 200-300 ml of milk and milk products and 400 g 
of vegetables and fruits to provide fibre, micro-nutrients and antioxidants. Inclusion 
of these items in the diet improves the quality of the diet and bowel function. Flesh 
foods and eggs add to the quality of diet (annexure 14 & 15 ).
The diet needs to be well cooked, soft and less salty and spicy. Small quantities of 
food should be consumed at more frequent intervals and adequate water should be 
consumed to avoid dehydration, hyponatraemia and constipation.
Exercise is an integral part of maintaining healthy life. It helps to regulate body 
weight. The risk of degenerative diseases is considerably decreased by regular 
exercise. Exercise schedule should be decided in consultation with a physician.

physical activity of moderate intensity (such as brisk walking 5-6 km/hr) 5-6 days of the week. 
Greater health benefits can be obtained by engaging in physical activity of longer duration or 
more vigorous intensity such as jogging, running, cycling and swimming.
Sedentary people embarking on a physical activity programme should undertake a 
moderate intensity activity of short duration to start with and gradually increase the duration 
or intensity. Other day-to-day activities like walking, housework, gardening, will be beneficial 
not only in weight reduction but also for lowering of blood pressure and serum triglycerides. It 
also elevates HDL (good) cholesterol in blood. Simple modification in lifestyle like 
deliberately climbing up the stairs instead of using the lift and walking for short distance 
instead of using a vehicle could also immensely help in increasing our physical activity.
Exercise program should include 'warm up' and 'cool down' periods each lasting for 5 
minutes. During exercise, the intensity of exercise should ensure 60-70% increase in heart 
rate.
Inactive men over the age of 40 years, women over the age of 50 years and people at 
high risk for chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes should first consult a physician 
before engaging in a program of vigorous physical activity such as running and swimming.

Forty five minutes per day of moderate intensity physical activity provides many 
health benefits. However, even greater health benefits can be gained through more 
vigorous exercise or by staying active for a longer time. This also burns more 
calories. Regardless of the activity being selected, one can do it all at once or divide 
it into two or three parts during the day.

Removal of the Pesticide Residues from the Food Products by 
Different Methods
Most of the pesticide residues can be removed by adopting four methods.  
These methods should be easily adopted at the house hold level to remove the 
pesticide residues. These methods are washing, blanching, peeling and cooking.  
Washing
The first step in the removal of pesticide residues from the food products is 
washing. About 75-80% of pesticide residues are removed by cold water washing. 
Washing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that 
normally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits.  
The pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava, 
plums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, okra require 
2-3 washings. The green leafy vegetables must be washed with 2% salt water. The 
pesticide residues from green leafy vegetables is removed satisfactorily by normal 
processing such as washing, blanching and cooking.
Blanching
Blanching is a short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the 
vegetables. Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching.  
But before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and 
fruits.  
Peeling 
Contact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be 
removed by peeling. Steps such as concentration, dehydration, and extraction from 
the raw product can further reduce pesticide residues in the end produce. The net 
influence of processing almost always results in minimal residues in processed 
food.
Annexure - 12
115
Cooking
Animal Products
Animal products are also the major source of contamination for pesticide 
residues in human diets since the animals feed on fodder, which are sprayed with 
pesticides.  Pressure cooking, frying and baking will minimize the harmful effect 
pesticide residues.  
Dairy products 
Boiling of milk at high temperatures will destroy the persistent pesticide 
residues.  
Vegetable Oils   
Refined oils will have fewer amounts of pesticide residues.  Household heating 
of oils will minimize pesticide residues.

North Carolina’s Guide to
Diabetes Prevention  
and Management
Diabetes Prevention, 
Diagnosis and Management
Introduction
In 2020, nearly one-half of North Carolinians have diabetes (12.5% of the population1) or are at high risk  
for developing diabetes (34.5% of adults have prediabetes2). It is also projected that over 3,000 people will die 
directly or indirectly because of diabetes and its complications, ranking North Carolina as 7th in the nation  
for diabetes related deaths.3
Diabetes is a complex disease and daily self-management can 
be challenging. Uncontrolled diabetes is associated with serious 
complications (e.g., heart disease, hypertension, stroke, vision loss, 
kidney failure, nerve damage, depression, and hearing loss), which 
negatively impact quality of life for persons with diabetes. In addition to 
the substantial personal burden of diabetes to those who have it, and 
the families who also are touched by caregiving, there are substantial 
financial burdens to individuals, employers, health systems, and 
communities across the state including multiple levels of government. 
The annual healthcare cost of diabetes in North Carolina is estimated to 
surpass $17 billion by 2025.4
In addressing diabetes as a complex disease and the challenges of 
reducing its burdens, NC must consider personal and environmental 
factors at individual, relationship, community, and societal levels. 
Our behaviors as individuals shape and are shaped by our social, 
economic, and policy environment. Together these terms are often 
grouped and referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). 
In addition to caring for those who already have diabetes, preventing 
diabetes and related complications, 
if not delaying onset of the disease, 
is important at the individual, 
community, and systems level. 
North Carolina’s Guide to
Diabetes Prevention  
and Management 2020
This Guide is organized around four levels of social and 
environmental concepts described by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Socio-Ecological 
Model of Health (SEM) (Figure 1). 
The Guide:
1.	
Addresses what diabetes is and what diabetes looks 
like in North Carolina. 
2.	
Focuses on actions that individuals at risk for diabetes 
or who have diabetes, families, and peers can implement 
to improve the health of North Carolinians.
3.	
Provides specific strategies for community groups, employers,  
and healthcare providers to implement toward assisting people  
to manage their risk for developing and/or managing diabetes, including 
reducing risk of complications. 
4.	
Shares opportunities to focus on what we can do in our various 
communities to reduce the burden of diabetes, and the evolving role for 
our broader society including policy and advocacy in North Carolina. 
Statistics Used in this Guide: Throughout this Guide, we have made 
every effort to cite the most recent statistics available at the time of going 
to press.
The Guide’s mission is to reduce the burden of diabetes in North 
Carolina. The North Carolina Diabetes Advisory Council (NC DAC) 
hopes that the information presented in the Guide will increase 
understanding of the impact of diabetes in North Carolina for our 
audience (or readers), and what we as individuals, families, and  
our communities across the state can do to reduce these burdens.

Society
The larger role  
of our society and 
 
the state in advocacy 
 
and policy has 
 
an impact on 
 
an individual’s  
ability to sustain  
behavior change.
Community
The role of employers, 
schools, media, 
local governments, 
 
non-profits, faith- 
 
based, professional, 
 
and other organiza- 
 
tions creates an 
environment that  
affects an 
individual’s ability 
to sustain behavior 
change.
Individual
Individual decisions 
are based on 
attitudes, beliefs, 
knowledge, and 
behaviors.
Relationship
The relationships 
of an individual 
(peers, partners, 
family members, 
healthcare providers, 
etc.) affect his or her 
ability to sustain 
behavior change.
Modeling the Language of Diabetes
Words matter in diabetes care and management. Persons diagnosed 
with prediabetes or diabetes communicate and engage with their 
healthcare team, families, friends, employers, communities, etc., in 
order to successfully manage their diabetes. Language is the tool that 
makes effective communication possible and supports the person with 
diabetes on this journey. All language should be person centric. Words 
that promote inclusion, respect, positivity, and acceptance without 
judgment fosters collaboration between persons with or at risk for 
diabetes and their healthcare team.
Throughout this guide we will model language that enhances written 
and spoken communication when discussing diabetes. We have added 
the research recommendations from the joint task force of the American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Association of Diabetes Care and 
Education Specialists (ADCES) that addresses language best practices 
in the delivery of diabetes care and diabetes self-care management 
education and support (DSMES).7
This Guide is also a Call to Action to prevent and 
manage diabetes. After reading it, we hope you will 
join the NC DAC in our mission to make a difference.

How Can Diabetes Be 
Prevented or Delayed?
This section describes how to prevent diabetes from occurring 
or dramatically delaying it (primary prevention), including special 
considerations for those at high risk who should aggressively work on 
reducing their risk, and also be monitored for early onset of diabetes 
through early detection or screening. In the following section we will 
address the management of diabetes in persons already diagnosed 
and strategies to prevent complications through individual and group 
self-management programs and the importance of persistence with 
prescribed medical therapy (tertiary prevention). 
Primary prevention in Type 1 diabetes remains a topic of intensive 
research, but few recommendations have emerged on how to prevent 
this form of diabetes. However, several long-term population studies 
and clinical trials show that most occurrences of Type 2 diabetes can 
indeed be prevented or delayed. 
Figure 2 shows the progression of diabetes and what individuals 
can do to prevent and manage diabetes at each stage.
While the North Carolina Diabetes Advisory Council supports efforts to find a cure for Type 1 
diabetes, a major focus of this Guide and the Diabetes Advisory Council is on Type 2 diabetes 
because it is more common and is potentially preventable. For the remainder of this document, 
the use of the word “diabetes” will be referring to Type 2 diabetes unless indicated otherwise.

Maintain a  
Healthy Weight
According to North 
Carolina’s Plan to Address 
Overweight and Obesity, 
developed by Eat Smart, Move 
More NC, excess weight can 
be caused by calorie intake 
that is greater than energy 
used, a sedentary lifestyle, and 
insufficient sleep and stress. 
Being overweight increases 
the chances of developing Type 2 diabetes by eight times.
40 On the 
other hand, for people who are overweight, losing 5 to 7% of their 
current weight can cut their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes 
in half.41 Effective weight loss programs are those that assist in the 
implementation of lifestyle changes such as adopting healthy eating 
habits, being more physically active, getting adequate sleep, managing 
stress, living tobacco free, and learning how to change behaviors.
Adopt Healthy Eating
Healthy eating can have a major impact on lowering the risk for 
prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. There are a variety of healthy eating 
patterns which can be tailored to each person that incorporate their 
favorite foods, traditions, and cultural preferences as well as address 
concerns related to religion or socioeconomic factors. Eating patterns 
represent the total of all foods and beverages consumed in a day. 
A registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN) can provide valuable 
information about how to eat healthy with prediabetes or diabetes, 
based the individual’s needs, goals, medications, food patterns, 
and preferences.42, 43 In this process, the person with prediabetes or 
diabetes and the dietitian collaborate to design a healthy meal plan 
which can be integrated into daily life with ease while addressing 
their specific eating pattern and nutritional needs. All persons with 
prediabetes or diabetes should be referred to a RDN initially and 
ongoing to establish their healthy eating meal plan and then modify 
as needed.42, 43 There is no single “best” meal plan for people with 
prediabetes and 
diabetes; rather a 
variety for managing 
prediabetes and diabetes 
are acceptable. In terms 
of evidence-based 
research regarding the 
comparative benefits of 
different eating patterns, 
the outcome data 
presently is not strong 
enough to endorse 
one eating pattern over 
another.
Diabetes Primary Prevention
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and can indeed be prevented if not delayed 
— 
 
sometimes for many years 
— 
by paying attention to the following healthy behaviors:
Maintain a healthy weight | Adopt healthy eating habits | Be more physically active | Live tobacco free | Get adequate sleep
Examples of some eating patterns
• Mediterranean Style
• 
DASH (Dietary 
Approaches 
to Stopping 
Hypertension)
• Vegetarian or Vegan
• Low Fat
• Low-Carbohydrate 
• 
Diabetes Plate

4
North Carolina’s Guide to Diabetes Prevention and Management 2020 – Diabetes Prevention, Diagnosis and Management
Focus on the key factors that are common among the eating patterns:43
• 
Food is comprised of three main nutrients that supply 
energy to the body 
— 
carbohydrates, proteins, and 
fats. All three should be incorporated into each meal in 
balance, which helps in improving glucose (sugar) and 
lipid (fat) levels.
• 
Emphasize non-starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, 
and dairy products.
• 
Although the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
2015 
– 
2020, recommend fat-free or low-fat dairy 
products, current research suggests full fat dairy 
products do not increase the risk for heart disease, 
stroke, or diabetes. It is reasonable to have 2 to 
3 servings per day of either full fat or low-fat non-
sweetened dairy products. Individualized nutrition 
patterns should include foods that lower the risk for 
chronic diseases, such as fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, 
and whole grains. Additional information about healthy 
eating patterns is provided in Table 1.44, 45, 46 
• 
Minimize added sugars and refined grains.
• 
Choose whole foods over highly processed foods to the 
extent possible. 
• 
Reduce overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with 
diabetes has the best evidence for improving high blood 
sugar and may be included in a variety of eating patterns 
that meet individual needs and preferences. 
• 
Healthy eating also focuses on reducing trans fats, 
portion control, avoiding added sugars and sodium.
• 
Alcohol can be used in moderation if not contraindicated 
due to other medical issues. As alcohol use in 
diabetes can lead to hypoglycemia, weight gain and 
hypoglycemia, it is recommended that individuals 
discuss the risks with their healthcare providers and limit 
intake to one drink daily for women and two for men.42, 43
• 
Studies show that one serving of a sugar sweetened 
beverage (SSB) per day increases the risk for Type 2 
diabetes in adults with prediabetes by nearly 25%.
47 
Dietary patterns that avoid SSB are encouraged, 
replacing them with water for fluid consumption. Persons 
with prediabetes or diabetes are encouraged to avoid 
SSBs although moderate use of natural and artificial 
sweeteners is acceptable. While non-nutritive sweeteners 
(NNS) do not appear to have a major effect on glucose 
management,
48 there is also evidence that they may 
actually contribute to excess weight gain and diabetes.
49 
• 
Daily recommended sodium (salt) intake is <2300 mg/
day for all adults.
• 
For those adults with Type 2 diabetes not meeting 
their blood glucose targets, or where reducing glucose 
lowering medications is a priority, reducing overall 
carbohydrate intake with low- or very low-carbohydrate 
eating plans may be considered in conjunction with 
ongoing guidance and follow-up by their healthcare 
team.
• 
Occasionally persons with diabetes may need to fast for 
religious reasons or before a medical procedure. Such 
fasting should be done carefully and with advice from 
their healthcare provider especially if taking insulin or 
medications that might lower blood sugar. Research on 
the risk and benefits of Intermittent Fasting as a dietary 
pattern in persons with diabetes remains limited and 
inconclusive. Persons with diabetes should not adopt 
this pattern without ongoing dialogue, monitoring and 
management by their diabetes care provider.50 
5
North Carolina’s Guide to Diabetes Prevention and Management 2020 – Diabetes Prevention, Diagnosis and Management
Fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains and fat-free or low-fat 
dairy and dairy products.
There is convincing evidence 
that meal plans rich in 
whole grains decrease risks 
associated with diabetes. 
Eating patterns rich in refined 
grains lead to increased risk.52 
Strong evidence supports 
a meal plan high in fruits 
and vegetables for weight 
management. They are lower 
in calories and high in volume 
and fiber. These foods are 
efficient because they are low 
in calorie and make you feel 
full longer. 
Additionally, avoid 
sugar sweetened 
beverages 
(SSB). 
Lean meats, poultry, fish, 
beans, eggs and nuts.
There is growing evidence 
that consumption of red 
meat (beef, pork, lamb) 
and processed red meat 
(bacon, hot dogs, deli 
meats) increases the risk 
of diabetes, even among 
people who consume only 
small amounts.
Moderate amounts of 
saturated fats, sodium 
and added sugars, and no 
trans fats. 
The types of fats in your 
meal plan can impact the 
development of diabetes. 
Healthy fats, including 
polyunsaturated or 
monounsaturated fats found 
in liquid vegetable oils, 
nuts and seeds can help 
decrease risks associated 
with prediabetes and Type 2 
diabetes. 
Calorie needs to achieve 
and maintain a healthy 
weight.
Maintaining a healthy weight 
requires keeping the number 
of calories consumed equal 
to the number of calories 
expended. Research shows 
that portion size influences 
how many calories a person 
consumes. Understanding 
portion sizes is important 
for individuals to accurately 
assess the number of 
calories he/she is consuming. 
Because oversized portions 
are common in restaurants, 
supermarkets and vending 
machines, it is important to 
be aware of and practice 
appropriate portions 
during meal 
preparation.53

Mobile Apps can be a game changer for people living with or working on preventing 
diabetes. However, when searching under “Diabetes” in an app store there are 
thousands of possibilities. In 2019, Ahn and Stahl reported on the pros and cons of apps 
and how these can be integrated into clinical practice.
54 These apps can help with a 
variety of self-care behaviors and help the person keep track of their goals, progress, and 
successes. Each app is unique and each person must be part of the selection process, 
as with any other diabetes technology, as they are the end user. The apps listed below 
have proved successful for people with prediabetes or diabetes.

Be More  
Physically Active 
Increased physical activity 
plays a major role in the 
prevention and improvement of 
insulin resistance, prediabetes, 
gestational diabetes, Type 2 
diabetes and diabetes-related 
health complications. Insulin 
resistance can be present in 
both those who have obesity 
and are overweight, as well as 
those at a healthy weight (lean 
diabetes mellitus).
55 Aerobic, 
resistance training and intentional stretching improve insulin action and 
can assist with long- term management of blood glucose levels, lipids, 
blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, mortality and quality of life. 
The ADA and the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) 
recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity, mostly aerobic 
physical activity, per week, spread over at least three days per week 
with no more than two consecutive days without exercise. According 
to the CDC, moderate activity can be assessed using a rating of 
perceived exertion (Borg rating) or how hard one feels they are working 
based on: 
• Increased heart rate.	
• Increased sweating.
• Increased respiration or breathing rate.	
• Muscle fatigue.56 
Unless your healthcare provider recommends otherwise, resistance 
training should also be included at least twice per week, with one or 
more sets of at least five different resistance training exercises.8 
Efforts to promote physical activity should focus on developing self-
efficacy and fostering social support from family, friends and healthcare 
providers and working with communities on accessible, affordable 
physical activity options. Encouraging mild or moderate physical 
activity may be most beneficial to adoption and maintenance of regular 
physical activity participation. Joining a gym or health club might be 
motivating and enjoyable, but everyone can increase their level of 
activity and physical fitness at home, including cardio and strength, with 
minimal resources and equipment. 
Live Tobacco Free
Smoking is a proven risk factor for diabetes, with people who 
smoke being 30 
– 
40% more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than 
those who don’t smoke.57 The more someone smokes, the greater the 
chance of developing diabetes.58 While smoking can increase the risk 
of developing diabetes, it can also make diabetes management more 
difficult. Among those with diabetes, people who smoke are more 
likely to have problems maintaining proper blood sugar levels and may 
require larger doses of insulin to manage their blood sugar. 
Most importantly, people with diabetes who smoke are at a 
heightened risk of premature death and morbidity from serious 
complications such as heart disease and stroke, circulation problems, 
nerve damage, eye problems leading to blindness and kidney disease.
The American Diabetes Association advises all people not to use 
cigarettes and other tobacco products or e-cigarettes. In recent years 
e-cigarettes have gained public awareness and popularity because of 
perceptions that e-cigarette 
use is less harmful than 
regular cigarette smoking. 
Nicotine can raise blood 
sugar regardless if delivered 
by smoking or vaping.59 
However, in light of recent 
CDC evidence of deaths 
related to e-cigarette use, no 
persons should be advised to 
use e-cigarettes, either as a 
way to stop smoking tobacco 
or as a recreational drug.60

North Carolina’s Guide to Diabetes Prevention and Management 2020 – Diabetes Prevention, Diagnosis and Management
Get Adequate Sleep
Sleep is a complex and essential biological process that is required 
daily for all of us. Learning, memory processing, cellular repair and 
brain development are among the important functions of sleep.61 In 
addition to maintaining normal brain functioning, sleep has important 
roles in controlling the functions 
of many other body systems. 
Reducing the total hours of 
sleep can lead to serious 
consequences for almost all 
bodily organs and systems.62 
Getting adequate sleep is 
important. Sleep deprivation can 
contribute to the development 
of glucose intolerance, insulin 
resistance, diabetes and 
metabolic syndrome. A distinct 
rise and fall of blood sugar 
levels during sleep appears to be linked to sleep stages. Not sleeping 
at the right time, not getting enough sleep overall or not getting enough 
of each stage of sleep disrupts this pattern. For most adults getting 
seven to eight hours of quality sleep a day is needed to perform 
adequately, avoid a sleep debt and not have problem sleepiness during 
the day.63 Those who work night shifts, or change shifts frequently, are at 
a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes.64 
Poor quality sleep may also be associated with overeating and 
making unhealthy food choices by stimulating hunger signals or 
suppressing signals of fullness. In turn, overeating especially before 
going to sleep/going to bed makes it harder to fall asleep or remain 
asleep. 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease, and is very common in those with obesity. People with 
symptoms suggestive of OSA such as excessive daytime sleepiness, 
snoring, and/or episodes of not breathing while sleeping, should 
discuss these symptoms with their medical team. Sleep apnea 
treatment (lifestyle modification, continuous positive airway pressure, 
oral appliances, and surgery) significantly improves quality of life and 
blood pressure management and even the risk of sudden death.65 
Risk Factor Identification, Early Detection,  
and Screening8
Individuals at high risk for developing diabetes should seek annual 
screening to detect diabetes at its earliest stages when lifestyle and 
medication options might be most effective in preventing further 
progression or complications. Individuals who have one or more of the 
following: body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2; 
family history of diabetes; member of certain racial and ethnic groups; 
or history of gestational diabetes are particularly at risk for developing 
diabetes.66 Even without identifiable risk factors, early detection or 
screening recommendations for Type 2 diabetes suggest that non-
pregnant adults 45 years or older be screened, regardless of risk. If 
screening results are normal, repeat testing should be completed every 
three years; sooner if adults have any of the risk factors mentioned 
above or if symptoms of hyperglycemia develop (e.g., excessive 
urination and thirst, blurred vision, frequent yeast infections, non-healing 
wounds).

Preventing Prediabetes or Early Type 2 Diabetes
You’re at risk for developing prediabetes21 that can lead into Type 2 
diabetes if you:
• Are overweight
• Are 45 years or older
• Have a parent, brother, or sister with Type 2 diabetes
• Are physically active less than 3 times a week
• 
Have ever had gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) or 
given birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds
• 
Are African American, Hispanic/Latinx American, American Indian, or 
Alaska Native (some Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans are also 
at higher risk)
Middle-aged and older adults are at the highest risk for developing Type 2 diabetes,
11 
particularly if they have prediabetes, or women who have had gestational diabetes during 
any of their pregnancies. 
Once an individual is diagnosed with prediabetes, the main treatment goal is to delay 
or prevent progression to Type 2 diabetes primarily through behavioral changes and if 
indicated, medications. Losing a modest amount of weight (five to seven% of total body 
weight) through healthy eating and moderate physical activity (such as brisk walking 30 
minutes a day, five days a week), within the context of a lifestyle change program, has 
proven to be effective.
11 Programs like the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program 
can help you make healthy changes that have lasting results. North Carolina has over 75 
CDC-recognized Diabetes Prevention Program providers that offer either online or onsite 
classes. Visit DiabetesFreeNC to find a program near you.
Diabetes Prevention for People at High Risk
Some people are at higher risk than others of developing diabetes. In this section we will touch on preventing  
Type 1 diabetes, prediabetes 
— 
which is often considered a precursor to Type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes that 
can occur in some pregnant women, and some of the other conditions associated with diabetes or special risks.
Preventing Type 1 
Diabetes
People at highest 
risk for Type 1 diabetes 
are those who have a 
parent, brother, or sister 
with Type 1 diabetes. While 
Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age 
it most commonly starts in children or 
young adults. This type of diabetes is 
thought to be the result of an autoimmune 
reaction where the body’s immune system 
mistakenly attacks itself. Risk factors for 
Type 1 diabetes are not as clear as for 
prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes although 
Caucasians are more likely to develop 
Type 1 diabetes than African Americans 
and Hispanic/Latinx Americans. Currently, 
no one knows how to prevent Type 1 
diabetes.67
10
North Carolina’s Guide to Diabetes Prevention and Management 2020 – Diabetes Prevention, Diagnosis and Management
Preventing 
Gestational Diabetes
You’re at risk for 
developing gestational 
diabetes14 (diabetes while 
pregnant) if you:
• 
Had gestational diabetes during a previous 
pregnancy
• 
Have given birth to a baby who weighed 
more than 9 pounds
• Are overweight
• Are more than 25 years old
• Have a family history of Type 2 diabetes
• 
Have a hormone disorder called polycystic 
ovary syndrome (PCOS)69 
• 
Are African American, Hispanic/Latinx 
American, American Indian, Alaska Native, 
Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander
Gestational diabetes usually goes away 
after the baby is born but increases the 
mother’s risk for prediabetes and Type 
2 diabetes later in life. Babies born from 
mothers with gestational diabetes are also 
more likely to become obese as a child or 
teen and are also more likely to develop 
Type 2 diabetes later in life. Before someone 
gets pregnant, they may be able to prevent 
gestational diabetes by losing weight if 
overweight, by eating healthier, and by getting 
regular physical activity.67, 70
Other Conditions Associated with Diabetes
Other conditions can cause the body to gradually become more resistant to working 
with the insulin it produces causing a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Here 
we will touch on only some of the more common conditions associated with diabetes. A 
constellation of metabolic abnormalities known as the Metabolic Syndrome include high 
LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides (another lipid) and low HDL (good) cholesterol, 
elevated blood pressure, excessive body fat especially around the waist, and insulin 
resistance that can lead to high blood sugar. The Metabolic Syndrome can be one of 
the most common causes of Prediabetes where resistance to our own insulin gradually 
increases to the point that we cannot fully metabolize the glucose we take in. If we cannot 
keep pace with the amount of insulin required to overcome that resistance, our blood 
sugar levels rise enough until we are diagnosed as having Type 2 diabetes. The good 
news is the Metabolic Syndrome, Prediabetes and many of the conditions listed below 
can be managed with diet, exercise and sometimes medications to prevent the onset of 
complications including diabetes.
Other metabolic states associated with insulin resistance include medical 
conditions such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Cushing’s Syndrome (an excess of 
cortisol hormones), Acromegaly (growth hormone excess) and liver disorders called 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).71 
NAFLD is characterized by increased fatty deposits in the liver and is present over 
half of those with Type 2 diabetes.
72 Some individuals with NAFLD further develop an 
inflammatory reaction that can lead to liver scaring, called NASH, which can further 
progress to cirrhosis. Because NAFLD/NASH either co-exists with or is just a different 
way that the underlying metabolic syndrome presents, as our population becomes more 
obese, these fatty liver disorders become part of the epidemic of Type 2 diabetes across 
all age groups world-wide. Currently the American Diabetes Association recommends 
that patients with Type 2 diabetes and elevated liver enzymes or fatty liver on an 
ultrasound should be evaluated for the presence of NASH and liver fibrosis.8 
People with other autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease and autoimmune 
thyroid disease as well as those infected with the hepatitis C virus are also at higher 
risk of developing diabetes, probably due to additional insults on the pancreas by an 
overactive immune system reducing the proper output of insulin when needed. Therefore, 
people with autoimmune diseases should be monitored for developing diabetes through 
periodic screening.8

Medication Options to Prevent Diabetes  
among People at High Risk
As previously mentioned, there are currently no known strategies 
to prevent Type 1 diabetes. Those at high risk for prediabetes or Type 
2 diabetes, and who already have underlying medical conditions 
also known to increase the risk of diabetes such as Polycystic Ovary 
Syndrome (PCOS), Cushing’s disease, Acromegaly, NASH, etc., should 
seek medical care for adequate management of these disorders 
including medication and/or surgery as needed.
Persons with prediabetes might also consider medication 
supplements to reduce obesity in addition to health dietary patterns 
and exercise. Although not approved by the FDA for the purpose 
of preventing Type 2 diabetes, several clinical trials suggest that a 
drug called metformin may be beneficial in preventing progression of 
prediabetes to Type 2 diabetes.8
Getting Help Through Education  
and Diabetes Prevention Programs
Healthcare providers, Diabetes Care and Education Specialists, 
registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN), pharmacists, lifestyle coaches, 
and other healthcare providers can assist in individual and group 
diabetes prevention education. 
In 2010, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
created The National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) to 
address prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes prevention through a CDC-
recognized lifestyle change program. This yearlong lifestyle change 
program is evidence-based and helps people who have prediabetes 
and/or are at risk for Type 2 diabetes make achievable and realistic 
lifestyle changes and reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 
up to 58%.73 Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) classes are designed 
to empower people with prediabetes to take charge of their health and 
well-being. Participants learn ways to incorporate healthier eating and 
moderate physical activity, as well as problem-solving, stress-reduction 
and coping skills into their daily lives. The DPP classes are delivered 
either in-person or virtually with a trained lifestyle coach for at least 16 
sessions in the first 6 months, then at least 6 follow-up sessions in the 
next 6 months. The CDC recognition assures that DPPs deliver quality 
and evidence-based support.

Diabetes Prevention Programs in North Carolina
North Carolina has over 75 CDC-recognized Diabetes Prevention 
Program providers that offer either online or onsite classes. Diabetes 
Prevention Programs are offered in varied community locations such 
as local health departments, YMCAs, community centers, faith-based 
organizations, hospitals and worksites. In 2016, the North Carolina 
General Assembly made funding available to the North Carolina 
Division of Public Health (NC DPH) for the North Carolina Office of 
Minority Health and Health Disparities (NC OMHHD) to establish 
and administer an evidenced-based diabetes prevention program 
targeting African-Americans, Hispanic/Latinx and American Indians 
(HB 1030, 2015-241, Section 12E.3). The goal of the North Carolina 
Minority Diabetes Prevention Program (NC MDPP) is to establish a 
statewide framework to decrease the incidence of diabetes in minority 
communities. The NC MDPP strives for health equity in all practices and 
policies, and was created to address the many barriers and challenges 
that exist within minority communities to seek and receive equitable 
programs and services. 
NC Prevents Diabetes is a partnership between NC State University 
and the NC Division of Public Health with Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
of North Carolina to offer diabetes prevention programs to all North 
Carolinians regardless of insurance status. This project is made 
possible through $5 million in funding from Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of North Carolina. This funding supports both online and onsite 
programs across the state by covering the program registration fee 
(current average cost = 
$430) as well as providing 
participant incentives and 
optional transportation and 
childcare supports. The goal 
of the project is to remove the 
barrier of cost to participate 
in a diabetes prevention 
program. Visit DiabetesFreeNC 
to find a program near you.
Medicare Diabetes Prevention Programs74 
Medicare’s Diabetes Prevention Program expanded model is a 
structured behavior change intervention that aims to prevent the onset 
of type 2 diabetes among Medicare beneficiaries with an indication of 
prediabetes. It differs from other DPPs in that Medicare requires that a 
diabetes prevention program has received CDC Diabetes Prevention 
Recognition to be eligible for reimbursement. Check with your local 
Medicare Office if you have questions.
Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers the costs of a diabetes 
prevention program once, if all of these conditions apply to you:

Facts about the A1C
•	 
It is possible for persons with prediabetes to lower their A1C value below 5.7% to halt 
progression towards the development of diabetes. 
•	 
The A1C test is also used for people already diagnosed with diabetes to assess 
hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels).
•	 
It is recommended that persons with diabetes aim to keep their A1C level below 
6.5% without hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) with the goal of preventing 
complications. It should be noted this goal is individualized for each person based 
on age, medications, concomitant health issues, and other factors such as barriers to 
care, personal issues, and social determinants of health.
•	 
HbA1 can be inaccurate in patients with anemia, iron or b12 deficiency, sickle cell, 
thalassemia, or blood loss.
The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) can also be referred to as fasting blood glucose 
(FBG) is also used to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes. Fasting is defined as no 
caloric intake for at least 8 hours. This test is most reliable when given in the morning. 
FBG is one of the most commonly used tests for diagnosing diabetes.
•	 FPG less than 100 mg/dl fasting is considered normal.
•	 FPG ≥ 100 and ≤ 125 mg/dl are diagnostic for prediabetes 
•	 
FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL is positive for diabetes (when found on more than one occasion)
The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is another method used to diagnose 
prediabetes, diabetes, and gestational diabetes. This test is usually performed after 
overnight fasting and measures blood glucose before and two hours after a person 
drinks a standardized liquid containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test 
is often used for prediabetes screening as it identifies post meal hyperglycemia, which 
often presents prior to an increase in the fasting glucose level. 
•	 Normal: a blood sugar level at 2 hours of ≤ 140 mg/dL 
•	 Prediabetes is diagnosed at a two-hour blood glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dl,
•	 Diabetes is diagnosed at two-hour blood glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dl.
For persons presenting to a healthcare provider or facility with symptoms of diabetes, 
or hyperglycemia crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL whether fasting or not is 
also considered diagnostic for diabetes.
Diagnosis Criteria
There are several methods that can be 
used to diagnose both prediabetes and 
diabetes. These involve blood testing at either 
a healthcare provider’s office or commercial 
laboratory. It should be noted that a positive 
result based on one test alone in the 
absence of symptomatic hyperglycemia 
(high blood glucose levels) is insufficient. 
Diagnosis is best confirmed based on 
validation by two abnormal test results.76
Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) is one test used 
to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. This 
blood test measures the average amount of 
glucose circulating in the blood stream during 
the past three-month period. (Hemoglobin is 
a protein found in red blood cells that carries 
oxygen in the blood. Glucose adheres to the 
hemoglobin on these red blood cells; so, by 
measuring the Hemoglobin A1C, it is possible 
to know the average % of circulating glucose 
during this time frame.)
•	 
A1C result in the range of ≥ 5.7 to 6.4% 
is considered a positive diagnosis for 
prediabetes.
•	 
A1C result ≥ 6.5 % is considered a 
positive diagnosis of diabetes.

Time in Range (TIR) and emerging tool for clinical management. 
An estimated 30 
– 
40% of persons with Type 1 diabetes as well as a growing number of those 
with insulin requiring Type 2 diabetes use insulin pumps, continuous glucose sensor monitors 
(CGM), or integrated insulin pump/CGM devices as tools for diabetes management.78 
Today, the new “hybrid “models of insulin pumps are designed to deliver insulin, integrate 
glucose monitoring and provide diabetes management software that offers comprehensive data 
analysis related to related to both insulin doses and daily life activities. Many of these hybrid 
insulin pumps are now fully integrated with CGMs; offering the person with diabetes and their 
healthcare team real-time data to assist in the management of 
diabetes. Careful review of the comprehensive data provided by 
these hybrid pumps/CGM integrated systems has unveiled a new 
metric which can also be used to assess overall glycemic control 
called Time in Range (TIR).79
While A1C can be used to diagnose diabetes, it does not 
address the constant changes of glucose levels, hypoglycemia, or 
daily glucose patterns and trends. TIR identifies both the percentage of time and specific time 
frames where glucose is above or below the individual’s recommended target and provides 
useful information regarding patterns and trends related to food timing, insulin dosing, exercise 
and daily activity, hypoglycemia, and illness. 
TIR is also a more accurate measure than A1C for assessing glycemic control in persons 
with those conditions where A1C values are less accurate (iron deficiency and other anemias, 
hemoglobin abnormalities, and pregnancy).79 A recent retrospective analysis of Diabetes 
Control and Complication Trial (DCCT)89 and other studies80 demonstrated that TIR is strongly 
Diabetes Management  
and Prevention of Complications
For persons with diabetes, the key to managing their illness, blood sugars and preventing complications is following 
their health provider’s clinical recommendations including medication adherence, screening for early signs of 
complications and adopting healthy behaviors.
Clinical Considerations

clinical recommendations such as those 
from the American Diabetes Association 
Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes.8

associated with reduced risk of microvascular complications (e.g., 
retinopathy and microalbuminuria: small amounts of protein in the urine 
above what is normal and typically an early sign of kidney disease) 
in persons with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes when the TIR percent 
increased. A TIR value of 70% strongly aligns with an A1C of 7,81, 82 
and the clinical recommendation is to keep TIR ≥ 70% for a minimal 
of 16 hours/day.79 In clinical practice, time in range is a useful tool 
that complements A1C as metrics for both targets and outcomes in 
optimizing diabetes care and management.
A TIR Tip-Sheet is available. 
TIR targets:
•	 
A target range of 70 
–180 mg/dL for individuals with Type 1 
diabetes and Type 2 diabetes,
•	 
And 63 
–140 mg/dL during pregnancy, along with a set of targets 
for the time per day [% of CGM readings or minutes/hrs.]. 
•	 
Recommendations also outline setting conservative CGM targets 
for persons with diabetes who are older and/or considered high-
risk, with a strong focus on reducing the percentage of time spent 
in hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia.
Diabetes Self-Care Management Education and 
Support (DSMES) 
— 
A Critical Tool for Adopting  
(or Developing) Healthy Self-Care Behaviors
For persons with diabetes, a critical tool for managing blood glucose 
and preventing complications is successfully practicing the AADE7 
Self-Care Behaviors® (Figure 3) and incorporating those skills and 
processes into their everyday routines. These behaviors are healthy 
eating, being active, monitoring, taking medications, problem solving, 
reducing risk, and healthy coping. These skills assist people with 
diabetes in their efforts to manage and stabilize their blood glucose 
levels within the range recommended by their healthcare team as well as 
providing recommended clinical preventative measures for overall health 
maintenance and risk reduction. Evidence based research demonstrates 
that managing diabetes by keeping glucose within recommended 
individual target ranges reduces the risk for complications, slows 
the progression of the disease and improves health outcomes.83, 84 
This is best accomplished through a patient centric 
collaborative team approach that includes the 
individual’s primary and diabetes healthcare providers, 
diabetes self-care management and support (DSMES) 
team, specialists if indicated and ongoing support.85 
DSMES provides people affected by diabetes with the critical 
survival skills and strategies to manage their diabetes as well as 
ongoing support as they integrate these processes into daily life. 
Diabetes care and education (also referred to as diabetes self-
management education and support or diabetes self-management 
training, or DSMT), is performed by healthcare professionals who have 
appropriate credentials and experience within their scope of practice. 
DSMES services are provided by a variety of credentialed professionals 
such as nurses, registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN), pharmacists, 
and Certified Diabetes Care and Educational Specialists (CDCES).

DSMES services are designed to address the person’s health beliefs, cultural needs, 
current knowledge, physical limitations, emotional concerns, family support, financial 
status, medical history, health literacy, numeracy, and other factors and barriers that 
influence each person’s ability to meet the challenges of self-care.86 These providers 
can be found in a variety of settings: hospitals, physician offices, clinics, pharmacies, 
home health, wellness programs, health departments, or communities. The initial DSMES 
referral is provided by a primary care provider (PCP) to a formal DSMES program. 
Ongoing support services can be provided within PCP or endocrinology practices as 
well as in a variety of community-based resources such as rural health centers, health 
departments, support groups, faith-based programs, payer-based programs, or by 
community health workers. A flyer (Thrive with Diabetes) is available for more information 
about DSMES services and about when to refer. 
Evidence-based research demonstrates that engaging adults with diabetes in 
DSMES results in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in A1C. 
The greatest improvements are achieved when DSMES includes both individual and 
group education, is provided by a team, participants attend more than 10 hours, and 
is individualized to address each 
person’s unique needs. Additionally, 
DSMES is focused on behaviors and 
engages the person with diabetes in 
this process.87 
When to Refer for DSMES
There are four critical times when 
DSMES should be provided for Type 2 
diabetes (Figure 4):
• At diagnosis
• 
Annually and when not meeting 
targets
• When complicating factors occur
• When transitions in care occur

These times identified in Figure 4 are critical points when people with diabetes may 
need assistance to achieve and/or adjust their goals and care plans for successful daily 
self-management.89 Because diabetes is a chronic disease that progresses over time, 
ongoing vigilance and flexibility are necessary to address and adjust changing needs or 
treatments. Referrals for DSMES may be needed more frequently than just these specific 
4 times. Diabetes care and education plans at each of the 4 critical times include 
individual assessments that focus on the needs and experiences of the person with 
diabetes relevant to self-management and applicable treatment targets.90 
Self-Care Recommendations for Persons with Diabetes
For persons with diabetes, it is recommended to follow-up with your diabetes care 
team every 3 months to help stay healthy with living with diabetes. During these visits, 
people with diabetes should expect to have: 
•	 
A1C checked and compared to blood 
sugars from home
•	 Blood pressure checked
•	 
Blood and/or urine chemistries to assess 
kidney function, with a referral to a 
specialist as needed
•	 
Lipid (cholesterol) levels (at least once a 
year)
•	 
A foot exam (take off those shoes and 
socks) and importance of daily self-foot 
exam at home to inspect for changes in 
skin or temperature, infections, fungus, 
cracks, fissures, corns or callous, ingrown 
nails, edema or decreased sensation
•	 
Screening for depression or distress; 
let your provider know if you are 
overwhelmed by managing your 
diabetes, are feeling depressed, or find it 
challenging to cope
•	 
Screening for tobacco use or vaping 
•	 
Reminder to see your dentist two times/
year and to brush and floss teeth daily
•	 
Assessment for sleep apnea, with a 
referral to a specialist as needed
•	 
Referral to an audiologist at the time 
of diagnosis for hearing evaluation 
and screening for risk of falls (future 
evaluations might be required based on 
the full medical history)
•	 
A review of your individualized, patient-
focused plan of care for managing your 
diabetes
•	 
Referral to an eye care provider at least 
once a year who can perform a dilated 
eye exam
•	 
Review of all your immunizations to 
ensure you are up to date: flu vaccine 
(yearly), pneumonia vaccines, hepatitis B 
vaccine, and discuss the need for a Tdap 
and/or MMR booster, shingles and HPV 
vaccines with your provider
•	 
Referral to see your DSMES team at the 
four critical times (e.g., when complicating 
factors occur) and annual follow-up 
review.

Preventing and Reducing Risks for Complications
Diabetes can lead to complications over time particularly when 
glucose levels remain elevated for extended periods of time and /or 
there is extreme glucose variability. Diabetes is associated with:
•	 
Macrovascular changes of the large blood vessels which can lead to 
cardiovascular disease (heart attack, strokes, hypertension), clotting 
disorders, amputations, hearing loss
•	 
Amputations: diabetes and complications of ulcerations lead to 50 
– 
75%  
of the non-traumatic amputations
•	 
Microvascular changes to the small blood vessels which can impact the 
eyes (retinopathy), ears (hearing), kidneys, end stage renal disease and 
dialysis (nephropathy), feet, hands, and nerves (neuropathy)
•	 
Gastroparesis (slower or incomplete emptying of the stomach) and 
impaired digestion secondary to central autonomic neuropathy
•	 
Peripheral vascular disease (altered or decreased circulation to the feet 
and legs, edema, nails and skin
•	 
Hearing Loss, deafness (both a microvascular change and neuropathy)
•	 
Periodontal (gum) disease, loss of dentition
•	 
Skin changes (skin tags, oral skin lesions, itching, infections due to 
bacteria, fungus, or yeast)
•	 
Vision changes or loss, Cataracts and Glaucoma
•	 
Sleep Apnea
•	 
Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
•	 
Other Endocrine or autoimmune disorders 
•	 
Persons with diabetes are at higher risk for Hepatitis B infection and more 
frequently develop complications from the flu or pneumonia
•	 
Increased risk of falls from loss of vision, foot neuropathy, and vestibular 
complications leading to potential fractures and head injury 
•	 
Depression and diabetes distress 
Preventing Other Complications
People with prediabetes, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are at high 
risk for developing cardiovascular disease including heart attack and 
stroke. They should be screened for other cardiovascular risk factors 
such as lipid disorders (high total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and 
triglycerides), high blood pressure and strongly counseled not to smoke.
8
Immunizations are important for persons with diabetes as protection 
from complications of flu, pneumonia, Hepatitis B, Shingles, Tetanus, 
Pertussis, and Diphtheria. All illnesses and infections in persons with 
diabetes causes glucose to rise to high levels (hyperglycemia), which 
in turn increases the difficulty to resolve these illnesses, which is why 
immunizations are important.8, 92
•	 
Annual flu vaccine
•	 
Hepatitis B vaccination for all adults with diabetes who have not previously 
been vaccinated for Hepatitis B and are younger than 60 years of age. 
•	 
Pneumococcal vaccines once as an adult before 65 years of age and then 
two more doses at 65 years or older
•	 
Shingles vaccine 
•	 
Tdap (Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis): Initially and then every ten years

The Language of Diabetes
Diabetes is a challenging and complex medical condition that 
demands intense engagement in the daily management on the part 
of the person with diabetes. The learning curve is rapid and steep; 
requiring mastery of multiple critical self-care skills and problem-solving 
strategies to successfully navigate this condition. Persons with diabetes 
must also integrate these new responsibilities into their other roles 
and obligations (spouse, parent, grandparent, manager, employer, 
employee, community member, household manager, caregiver, teacher, 
mentor, etc.). Persons and families who live with diabetes every day 
need ongoing support and encouragement from their healthcare teams, 
community, families, friends, and co-workers.
Language is the primary channel for sharing knowledge and 
verbalizing understanding.
7 Once heard or read, people transform 
words into meaning,95, 96 impacting their self-concept. Language is the 
center whereby a person determines their identity, social perception, 
20
North Carolina’s Guide to Diabetes Prevention and Management 2020 – Diabetes Prevention, Diagnosis and Management
attitudes, bias, and stereotypes. The use of certain words or phrases 
can intentionally or unintentionally express bias about personal 
characteristics (e.g., race, religion, health, or gender).7 Thus, language 
shapes the experience for the person with diabetes and impacts 
both the context and their perception of the information. Studies 
have demonstrated that the language used in diabetes care and 
management makes a huge difference in terms of behaviors, outcomes, 
and motivation.
The Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists 
(ADCES) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) formed a 
joint task force focused on language in diabetes care and education. 
This group reviewed the literature regarding language used in the 
delivery of diabetes care and education and made recommendations 
for language that enhances the communication process. Appropriate 
language should be used by all healthcare professionals and others 
when discussing diabetes through spoken or written words and can be 
used with a variety of audiences (people with diabetes, colleagues, or 
the public).7
Words to Avoid
•	 
Judgment (non-compliant, uncontrolled, don’t care, should, failure)
•	 
Fear/Anxiety (complications, blindness, death, Diabetic Ketoacidosis)
•	 
Labels/Assumptions (Diabetic, all persons with diabetes are fat, suffer)
•	 
Oversimplifications/Directives (lose weight, you should, you’ll get 
used to it, at least it’s not...)
•	 
Misunderstanding/Misinformation/Disconnected (cure, reverse, bad 
kind, you are fine) 
•	 
Body Language and Tone (no eye contact, accusatory tone)
BE AWARE AND CHOOSE YOUR WORDS WITH CARE
Table 3. List of Problematic Words and Preferred Words to Use.
Problematic
Preferred
Diabetic
Person living with diabetes
Test blood glucose
Check or Monitor
Control (Verb)
Manage 
– 
describe what the person is doing
Control (Noun)
Define what you mean with control and use A1C, 
blood glucose level 
Good 
/ 
Bad 
/ 
Poor
Safe/unsafe levels; target levels; use numbers and 
focus on facts instead of judgmental terms
Compliant 
/ 
Adherent
Takes medicine about half the time; Eats 
vegetables a few times a week; describe 
engagement and participation
Our words and messages are powerful. When our mindset places 
the person first, the language will follow, removing the labels of shame, 
guilt, and blame. When we hear language that is negative, speak up 
and advocate for persons with diabetes while educating those around 
us.97 Additional resources can be found at the Association of Diabetes 
Care & Education Specialists.98
•	 
Stigma that has historically been attached to a diagnosis of diabetes can 
contribute to stress and feelings of shame and judgment
•	 
Every member of the healthcare team can serve people with diabetes more 
effectively through a respectful, inclusive, and person-centered approach
•	 
Empowering language that focuses on the individual’s strengths can 
improve communication and enhance motivation, health, and well-being of 
people with diabetes.
•	 
Specific themes and associated words should be avoided.
There are four guiding principles:

INTRODUCTION 
Preventive healthcare (alternately preventive medicine or prophylaxis) consists of measures taken for 
disease prevention, as opposed to disease treatment(Katz and Ather, 2009; Hugh et.al, 1979) Just as 
health encompasses a variety of physical and mental states, so do disease and disability, which are 
affected by environmental factors, genetic predisposition, disease agents, and lifestyle choices. Health, 
disease, and disability are dynamic processes which begin before individuals realize they are affected. 
Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primary, secondary, and 
tertiary prevention (Hugh et.al, 1979). 
Each year, millions of people die preventable deaths.  A 2004 study showed that about half of all 
deaths in the United States in 2000 were due to preventable behaviors and exposures (Mokdad, et.al, 
2004). Leading causes included cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, unintentional 
injuries, diabetes, and certain infectious diseases (Mokdad, et.al, 2004).  This same study estimates that 
400,000 people die each year in the United States due to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle (Mokdad, 
et.al, 2004).  
According to estimates made by the World Health Organization(WHO), about 55 million people died 
worldwide 
in 
2011, 
two 
thirds 
of 
this 
group 
from 
non-communicable 
diseases, 
including cancer, diabetes, and chronic cardiovascular and lung diseases (The Top 10 Causes of Death, 
2014).  This is an increase from the year 2000, during which 60% of deaths were attributed to these 
diseases (The Top 10 Causes of Death, 2014). Preventive healthcare is especially important given the 
worldwide rise in prevalence of chronic diseases and deaths from these diseases. 
There are many methods for prevention of disease. It is recommended that adults and children aim to 
visit their doctor for regular check-ups, even if they feel healthy, to perform disease screening, identify 
risk factors for disease, discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle, stay up to date with 
immunizations and boosters, and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider (Vorvick, 
2013). 
Some 
common 
disease 
screenings 
include 
checking 
for hypertension (high 
blood 
pressure), hyperglycemia (high 
blood 
sugar, 
a 
risk 
factor 
for diabetes 
mellitus), hypercholesterolemia (high 
blood 
cholesterol), 
screening 
for colon 
cancer, depression, HIV and 
other 
common 
types 
of sexually 
transmitted 
disease 
such 
as chlamydia, syphilis, 
and gonorrhea, mammography (to 
screen 
for breast 
cancer), colorectal 
cancer screening, a pap test (to check for cervical cancer), and screening forosteoporosis. Genetic 
testing can also be performed to screen for mutations that cause genetic disorders or predisposition to 
certain diseases such as breast or ovarian cancer (Vorvick, 2013). However, these measures are not 
affordable for every individual and the cost effectiveness of preventive healthcare is still a topic of 
debate (Michael et.al, 2010; Cohen, et.al, 2008).

 Obesity treatment, prevention and management 
 
 
 
In this module we will discuss about Treatment and prevention and management of Obesity  
Obesity is excessively high amount of body fat or adipose tissue in relation to lean body mass. Everyone needs a certain 
amount of body fat for stored energy, heat insulation, shock absorption, and other functions. genreally, women have more 
body fat than men.  
• 
Obesity means having too much body fat.  
• 
It is not the same as being overweight, which means weighing too much.  
• 
A person may be overweight from extra muscle, bone, or water, as well as from having too much fat. 
 
Obesity has gained epidemic proportions in our world today and the developed countries seem to be 
affected more than the other countries. However, all are catching up fast with this serious disorder. Though the 
general awareness on this disorder has increased the problem seems to be growing without any end in sight. 
Obesity can lead to many serious health conditions like type II diabetes, cardio vascular diseases, osteoarthritis, 
gallstones and also some kind of cancers. Obesity can also contribute to the metabolic diseases. Further, it also 
negatively impacts the quality of life and self esteem. 
Definition 
Obesity is a complex disorder involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic 
concern. It increases your risk of diseases and health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes and high 
blood pressure. 
Being extremely obese means you are especially likely to have health problems related to your weight. 
The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated 
with obesity. Dietary changes, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose 
weight. Prescription medications and weight-loss surgery are additional options for treating obesity. 
Overweight vs. Obese 
Traditional Definitions 
 
Obese:  Body fatness above population norm 
 
Overweight:  Body weight above population norm

 Obesity treatment, prevention and management 
 
 
 
Obesity is diagnosed when your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or higher. Your body mass index is 
calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms (kg) by your height in meters (m) squared. 
What is Body Mass Index (BMI)? 
The BMI is a statistical measurement derived from your height and weight. Although it is considered 
to be a useful way to estimate healthy body weight, it does not measure the percentage of body fat. The 
BMI measurement can sometimes be misleading - a muscleman may have a high BMI but have much 
less fat than an unfit person whose BMI is lower. However, in general, the BMI measurement can be a 
useful indicator for the 'average person'.

For most people, BMI provides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However, BMI doesn't directly 
measure body fat, so some people, such as muscular athletes, may have a BMI in the obese category 
even though they don't have excess body fat. Ask your doctor if your BMI is a problem.   Fig: 3 
 
Symptoms and Complications of Obesity 
The health risks associated with obesity include: 
 
breathing disorders (e.g., sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)

 
certain types of cancers (e.g., prostate and bowel cancer in men, breast and uterine cancer in 
women) 
 
coronary artery (heart) disease 
 
depression 
 
diabetes 
 
gallbladder or liver disease 
 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
 
high blood pressure 
 
high cholesterol 
 
joint disease (e.g., osteoarthritis) 
 
stroke 
People who are obese may have the symptoms of the medical conditions mentioned above. High blood 
pressure, high cholesterol levels, breathing problems, and joint pain (in the knees or lower back) are 
common. The more obese a person is, the more likely they are to have medical problems related to 
obesity.

Aside from the medical complications, obesity is also linked to psychosocial problems such as low 
self-esteem, discrimination, difficulty finding employment, and reduced quality of life. Children who 
have a television in their bedroom are much more likely to be obese or overweight than kids who do

Obesity and quality of life 
When you're obese, your overall quality of life may be diminished. You may not be able to do things 
you used to do, such as participating in enjoyable activities. You may avoid public places. Obese 
people may even encounter discrimination. 
Other weight-related issues that may affect your quality of life include: 
 
Depression 
 
Disability 
 
Sexual problems 
 
Shame and guilt 
 
Social isolation 
 
Lower work achievement 
Tests and diagnosis 
If your BMI is in the obese range, your health care provider will typically review your health history in 
detail, perform a physical exam and recommend some tests. 
These exams and tests generally include: 
 
Taking your health history. Your doctor may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, 
exercise habits, eating patterns, what other conditions you've had, medications, stress levels and 
other issues about your health. Your doctor may also review your family's health history to see if 
you may be predisposed to certain conditions. 
 
A general physical exam. This includes also measuring your height; checking vital signs, such 
as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining 
your abdomen. 
 
Calculating your BMI. Your doctor will check your body mass index (BMI) to determine your 
level of obesity. This should be done at least once a year. Your BMI also helps determine your 
overall health risk and what treatment may be appropriate. 
 
Measuring your waist circumference. Fat stored around your waist, sometimes called visceral 
fat or abdominal fat, may further increase your risk of diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. 
Women with a waist measurement (circumference) of more than 35 inches (80 centimeters, or

cm) and men with a waist measurement of more than 40 inches (102 cm) may have more health 
risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, your waist 
circumference should be checked at least once a year. 
 
Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your doctor will 
evaluate them. Your doctor will also check for other possible health problems, such as high blood 
pressure and diabetes. 
 
Blood tests. What tests you have depend on your health, risk factors and any current symptoms 
you may be having. Tests may include a cholesterol test, liver function tests, a fasting glucose, a 
thyroid test and others. Your doctor may also recommend certain heart tests, such as an 
electrocardiogram. 
Gathering all this information helps you and your doctor determine how much weight you need to lose 
and what health conditions or risks you already have. And this will guide treatment decisions. 
Obesity Causes, Treatment, and Prevention 
Understanding obesity causes, treatment and prevention is one of the best things that you can 
do for yourself. Over the course of the last several decades, America has suffered from an increase in 
obesity due to a variety of factors. With more peopleeating fast food regularly and not getting enough 
exercise, it's no wonder that obesity has become a real epidemic. But there is more to it than just that. 
Find out the causes of obesity as well as the treatment and prevention of it in order to gain a better 
understanding of how it could affect you or someone you love. 
Causes of Obesity 
Obesity occurs when your body consumes more calories than it burns. In the past, many people 
thought that obesity was simply caused by overeating and under-exercising, resulting from a lack of 
will power and self-control. Although these are significant contributing factors, doctors recognize that 
obesity is a complex medical problem that involves genetic, environmental, behavioral, and social 
factors. All these factors play a role in determining a person's weight.

Recent research shows that in some cases, certain genetic factors may cause the changes in 
appetite and fat metabolism that lead to obesity. For a person who is genetically prone to weight 
gain (e.g., has a lower metabolism) and who leads an inactive and unhealthy lifestyle, the risk of 
becoming obese is high. 
Although a person's genetic makeup may contribute to obesity, it's not the primary cause. 
Environmental and behavioral factors have a greater influence – consuming excess calories from high-
fat foods and doing little or no daily physical activity over the long run will lead to weight gain. 
Psychological factors may also foster obesity. Low self-esteem, guilt, emotional stress, or trauma can 
lead to overeating as a means to cope with the problem. 
Although there are genetic, behavioral and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs 
when you take in more calories than you burn through exercise and normal daily activities. Your body 
stores these excess calories as fat. 
Obesity can sometimes be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing's 
syndrome, and other diseases and conditions. However, these disorders are rare and, in general, the 
principal causes of obesity are: 
 
Inactivity. If you're not very active, you don't burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, 
you can easily take in more calories every day than you use through exercise and normal daily 
activities. 
 
Unhealthy diet and eating habits. Weight gain is inevitable if you regularly eat more calories 
than you burn. And most Americans' diets are too high in calories and are full of fast food and 
high-calorie beverages. 
 
Risk factors 
Obesity usually results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, 
including: 
 
13 
 
 
Anthropology 
 
 Physiology and Sports Anthropology 
 
 Obesity treatment, prevention and management 
 
 
 
 
Genetics. Your genes may affect the amount of body fat you store, and where that fat is 
distributed. Genetics may also play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy 
and how your body burns calories during exercise. 
 
Family lifestyle. Obesity tends to run in families. If one or both of your parents are obese, your 
risk of being obese is increased. That's not just because of genetics. Family members tend to share 
similar eating and activity habits. 
 
Inactivity. If you're not very active, you don't burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, 
you can easily take in more calories every day than you burn through exercise and routine daily 
activities. Having medical problems, such as arthritis, can lead to decreased activity, which 
contributes to weight gain. 
 
Unhealthy diet. A diet that's high in calories, lacking in fruits and vegetables, full of fast food, 
and laden with high-calorie beverages and oversized portions contributes to weight gain. 
 
Medical problems. In some people, obesity can be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-
Willi syndrome, Cushing's syndrome and other conditions. Medical problems, such as arthritis, 
also can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain. 
 
Certain medications. Some medications can lead to weight gain if you don't compensate 
through diet or activity. These medications include some antidepressants, anti-seizure 
medications, diabetes medications, antipsychotic medications, steroids and beta blockers. 
 
Social and economic issues. Research has linked social and economic factors to obesity. 
Avoiding obesity is difficult if you don't have safe areas to exercise. Similarly, you may not have 
been taught healthy ways of cooking, or you may not have money to buy healthier foods. In 
addition, the people you spend time with may influence your weight — you're more likely to 
become obese if you have obese friends or relatives. 
 
Age. Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes 
and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. In addition, the amount of muscle in your 
body tends to decrease with age. This lower muscle mass leads to a decrease in metabolism. These 
changes also reduce calorie needs, and can make it harder to keep off excess weight. If you don't 
 
14 
 
 
Anthropology 
 
 Physiology and Sports Anthropology 
 
 Obesity treatment, prevention and management 
 
 
 
consciously control what you eat and become more physically active as you age, you'll likely gain 
weight. 
 
Pregnancy. During pregnancy, a woman's weight necessarily increases. Some women find this 
weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development 
of obesity in women. 
 
Quitting smoking. Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. And for some, it can 
lead to enough weight gain that the person becomes obese. In the long run, however, quitting 
smoking is still a greater benefit to your health than continuing to smoke. 
 
Lack of sleep. Not getting enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in 
hormones that increase your appetite. You may also crave foods high in calories and 
carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain. 
Even if you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn't mean that you're destined to become 
obese. You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise, and behavior 
changes. 
CAUSES OF OBESITY according to WHO  
 Energy Balance in the Development of Obesity can result from a minor energy imbalance, which lead 
to a gradual but persistent weight gain over a considerable period. Some researchers have hypothesized 
that energy imbalance is the result of inherited metabolic characteristics; whereas others believe it is 
caused by poor eating and lifestyle habits, that is “gluttony and sloth”. Positive energy balance occurs 
when energy intake is greater than energy expenditure and promotes weight gain (Figure 4). 
Conversely, negative energy balance promotes decrease in body fat stores and weight loss. Body 
weight is regulated by a series of physiological processes, which have the capacity to maintain weight 
within a relatively narrow range (stable weight). It is thought that the body exerts a stronger defense 
against under nutrition and weight loss than it does against over-consumption and weight gain. Figure 
4 also suggests that positive energy balance and weight gains are influenced by powerful societal and 
environmental forces which may overwhelm the physiological regulatory mechanisms that operate to 
keep weight stable. These include increasing automation, lack of recreational facilities and 
 
15

opportunities, increase in food variety and availability. Moreover, the susceptibility of individuals to 
these influences is affected by genetic and other biological factors such as sex, age and hormonal 
activities, over which they have little or no control (WHO 1998). 
Treatments of Obesity 
Obesity treatments have two objectives: 
1. 
 To achieve a healthy weight. 
2. 
To maintain that healthy weight. 
Because a poor diet and a lack of exercise are the most common causes of obesity, there are some 
fairly simple treatments for obesity. By incorporating more natural foods into your diet, drinking more 
water, cutting out junk food and getting into the habit of exercising several times every week, you can 
drastically lower your weight and decrease your chances of becoming obese. If you suffer from a 
disease like hypothyroidism, though, you will need to see your doctor to seek out other options. There 
are medications that can help regulate your thyroid gland and improve your rate of metabolism. This 
can help you to break down foods more efficiently and prevent you from gaining anymore weight in 
the future. It essentially helps to treat you and protect you from obesity.

Dietary changes 
Reducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are vital to overcoming obesity. Although you 
may lose weight quickly at first, slow and steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest 
way to lose weight and the best way to keep it off permanently. 
Avoid drastic and unrealistic diet changes, such as crash diets, because they're unlikely to help you 
keep excess weight off for the long term. 
Plan to participate in a comprehensive weight-loss program for at least six months and in the 
maintenance phase of a program for at least a year to boost your odds of weight-loss success. 
There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for 
you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: 
 
Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. You and 
your health care providers can review your typical eating and drinking habits to see how many 
calories you normally consume and where you can cut back. You and your doctor can decide how 
many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight, but a typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 
calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. 
 
Feeling full on less. The concept of energy density can help you satisfy your hunger with fewer 
calories. All foods have a certain number of calories within a given amount (volume). Some foods 
— such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods — are high in energy density. This means 
that a small volume of that food has a large number of calories. In contrast, other foods, such as 
fruits and vegetables, have lower energy density. These foods provide a larger portion size with a 
fewer number of calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you reduce 
hunger pangs, take in fewer calories and feel better about your meal, which contributes to how 
satisfied you feel overall.

 
Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods, 
such as fruits, vegetables and whole-grain carbohydrates. Also emphasize lean sources of protein 
— such as beans, lentils and soy — and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a 
week. Limit salt and added sugar. Stick with low-fat dairy products. Eat small amounts of fats, and 
make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. 
 
Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as 
high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your doctor which diet plans have been found effective 
and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume 
more calories than you intended, and limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good 
place to start cutting calories. 
 
Meal replacements. These plans suggest that you replace one or two meals with their products 
— such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars — and eat healthy snacks and a healthy, balanced third 
meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. 
Keep in mind that these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle, though, 
so you may have to keep this up if you want to keep your weight off. 
Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. The 
reality, however, is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, 
but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. 
Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To 
lose weight — and keep it off — you have to adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over 
time. 
Exercise and activity 
Increased physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment. Most people who are 
able to maintain their weight loss for more than a year get regular exercise, even simply walking. 
To boost your activity level: 
 
Exercise. People who are overweight or obese need to get at least 150 minutes a week of 
moderate-intensity physical activity to prevent further weight gain or to maintain the loss of a 
modest amount of weight. To achieve more-significant weight loss, you may need to exercise 300 
 
18 
 
 
Anthropology 
 
 Physiology and Sports Anthropology 
 
 Obesity treatment, prevention and management 
 
 
 
minutes or more a week. You probably will need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as 
your endurance and fitness improve. 
 
Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories 
and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. Making simple changes 
throughout your day can add up to big benefits. Park farther from store entrances, rev up your 
household chores, garden, get up and move around periodically, and wear a pedometer to track how 
many steps you actually take over the course of a day. 
Behavior changes 
A behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes and lose weight and keep it off. 
Steps to take include examining your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may 
have contributed to your obesity. 
Everyone is different and has different obstacles to managing weight, such as a lack of time to exercise 
or late-night eating. Tailor your behavior changes to address your individual concerns. 
Behavior modification, sometimes called behavior therapy, can include: 
 
Counseling. Therapy or interventions with trained mental health or other professionals can help 
you address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand 
why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You can also learn how to monitor 
your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Therapy can take 
place on both an individual and group basis. More-intensive programs — those that include 12 to 
26 sessions a year — may be more helpful in achieving your weight-loss goals. 
 
Support groups. You can find camaraderie and understanding in support groups where others 
share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your doctor, local hospitals or commercial 
weight-loss programs for support groups in your area, such as Weight Watchers. 
Prescription weight-loss medication 
Losing weight requires a healthy diet and regular exercise. But in certain situations, prescription 
weight-loss medication may help. 
 
19 
 
 
Anthropology 
 
 Physiology and Sports Anthropology 
 
 Obesity treatment, prevention and management 
 
 
 
Keep in mind, though, that weight-loss medication is meant to be used along with diet, exercise and 
behavior changes, not instead of them. If you don't make these other changes in your life, medication is 
unlikely to work. 
Your doctor may recommend weight-loss medication if other methods of weight loss haven't worked 
for you and you meet one of the following criteria: 
 
Your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or greater 
 
Your BMI is greater than 27, and you also have medical complications of obesity, such as 
diabetes, high blood pressure or sleep apnea 
Before selecting a medication for you, your doctor will consider your health history, as well as possible 
side effects. Some weight-loss medications can't be used by women who are pregnant, or people who 
take certain medications or have chronic health conditions. 
Commonly prescribed weight-loss medications include orlistat (Xenical), lorcaserin (Belviq), 
phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia), buproprion and naltrexone (Contrave), and liraglutide 
(Saxenda). 
Close medical monitoring is advised while taking a prescription weight-loss medication. Also, keep in 
mind that a weight-loss medication may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. 
When you stop taking a weight-loss medication, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. 
Weight-loss surgery 
In some cases, weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is an option. Weight-loss surgery 
limits the amount of food you're able to comfortably eat or decreases the absorption of food and 
calories or both. While weight-loss surgery offers the best chance of losing the most weight, it can pose 
serious risks. 
Weight-loss surgery for obesity may be considered if you have tried other methods to lose weight that 
haven't worked and: 
 
You have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or higher) 
 
Your BMI is 35 to 39.9, and you also have a serious weight-related health problem, such as 
diabetes or high blood pressure 
 
You're committed to making the lifestyle changes that are necessary for surgery to work

It doesn't guarantee that you'll lose all of your excess weight or that you'll keep it off long term. 
Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your 
eating and exercise habits. 
It doesn't guarantee that you'll lose all of your excess weight or that you'll keep it off long term. 
Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your 
eating and exercise habits. 
Common weight-loss surgeries include: 
 
Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), the surgeon creates a 
small pouch at the top of your stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the 
main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into 
this part of the intestine, bypassing most of your stomach. 
 
Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). In this procedure, your stomach is 
separated into two pouches with an inflatable band. Pulling the band tight, like a belt, the surgeon 
creates a tiny channel between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from expanding and is 
generally designed to stay in place permanently. 
 
Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. This procedure begins with the surgeon 
removing a large part of the stomach. The surgeon leaves the valve that releases food to the small 
intestine and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Then the surgeon closes off the 
middle section of the intestine and attaches the last part directly to the duodenum. The separated 
section of the intestine is reattached to the end of the intestine to allow bile and digestive juices to 
flow into this part of the intestine. 
 
Gastric sleeve. In this procedure, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir 
for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with 
duodenal switch. 
Other treatments 
Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of 
the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the 
brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology received FDA approval in 2014 for

use by adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss program and who have a BMI 
of 35 to 45 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes. 
Lifestyle and home remedies 
Your effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home in 
addition to your formal treatment plan. These can include: 
 
Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why 
you became obese and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control 
and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them 
with your doctor or therapist. 
 
Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a significant amount of weight, you may set 
goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. 
Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of 
attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul. 
 
Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years 
can be difficult. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care providers if you find 
your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new 
approaches. 
 
Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround 
yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they 
understand how important weight loss is to your health. You might also want to join a weight-loss 
support group. 
 
Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable 
for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover behavior that may be holding you back and, 
conversely, what works well for you. You can also use your log to track other important health 
parameters such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels and overall fitness. 
 
Identifying and avoiding food triggers. Distract yourself from your desire to eat with 
something positive, such as calling a friend. Practice saying no to unhealthy foods and big portions. 
Eat when you're actually hungry — not simply when the clock says it's time to eat. 
 
22 
 
 
Anthropology 
 
 Physiology and Sports Anthropology 
 
 Obesity treatment, prevention and management 
 
 
 
 
Taking your medications as directed. If you take weight-loss medications or medications to 
treat obesity-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, take them exactly as 
prescribed. If you have a problem sticking with your medication regimen or have unpleasant side 
effects, talk to your doctor. 
Alternative medicine 
Numerous dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The 
effectiveness, particularly the long-term effectiveness, and safety of these products are often 
questionable. 
Herbal remedies, vitamins and minerals, all considered dietary supplements by the Food and Drug 
Administration, don't have the same rigorous testing and labeling process as over-the-counter and 
prescription medications do. 
Yet some of these substances, including products labeled as "natural," have drug-like effects that can 
be dangerous. Even some vitamins and minerals can cause problems when taken in excessive amounts. 
Ingredients may not be standard, and they can cause unpredictable and harmful side effects. Dietary 
supplements also can cause dangerous interactions with prescription medications you take. Talk to 
your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. 
Mind-body therapies — such as acupuncture, mindfulness meditation and yoga — may complement 
other obesity treatments. However, these therapies generally haven't been well-studied in the treatment 
of weight loss. Talk to your doctor if you're interested in adding a mind-body therapy to your 
treatment. 
Prevention of Obesity 
If you are concerned about obesity, there are some things you can do to prevent it. First, make sure you 
are maintaining a healthy diet and getting enough exercise. Next, see you doctor regularly and make 
sure that you have her check your Body Mass Index, or BMI, to make sure you're not suffering from 
obesity. This is a test that takes your height and weight into account to determine your level of health. 
Regardless of how you do it, make sure you do everything you can to steer clear of obesity. Obesity 
risks range from heart attacks to diabetes. Obesity effects can also impact your everyday life and make 
it harder for you to enjoy it.

Whether you're at risk of becoming obese, currently overweight or at a healthy weight, you can 
take steps to prevent unhealthy weight gain and related health problems. Not surprisingly, the steps to 
prevent weight gain are the same as the steps to lose weight: daily exercise, a healthy diet, and a long-
term commitment to watch what you eat and drink. 
 
Exercise regularly. You need to get 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week 
to prevent weight gain. Moderately intense physical activities include fast walking and swimming. 
 
Follow a healthy eating plan. Focus on low-calorie, nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits, 
vegetables and whole grains. Avoid saturated fat and limit sweets and alcohol. Eat three regular 
meals a day with limited snacking. You can still enjoy small amounts of high-fat, high-calorie 
foods as an infrequent treat. Just be sure to choose foods that promote a healthy weight and good 
health most of the time. 
 
Know and avoid the food traps that cause you to eat.Identify situations that trigger out-of-
control eating. Try keeping a journal and write down what you eat, how much you eat, when you 
eat, how you're feeling and how hungry you are. After a while, you should see patterns emerge. 
You can plan ahead and develop strategies for handling these types of situations and stay in control 
of your eating behaviors. 
 
Monitor your weight regularly. People who weigh themselves at least once a week are more 
successful in keeping off excess pounds. Monitoring your weight can tell you whether your efforts 
are working and can help you detect small weight gains before they become big problems. 
 
Be consistent. Sticking to your healthy-weight plan during the week, on the weekends, and 
amidst vacation and holidays as much as possible increases your chances of long-term success. 
Preventing weight regain after obesity treatment 
Unfortunately, it's common to regain weight no matter what obesity treatment methods you try. If you 
take weight-loss medications, you'll probably regain weight when you stop taking them. You might 
even regain weight after weight-loss surgery if you continue to overeat or overindulge in high-calorie 
foods. But that doesn't mean your weight-loss efforts are futile. 
One of the best ways to prevent regaining the weight you've lost is to get regular physical activity. Aim 
for 60 minutes a day.

Keep track of your physical activity if it helps you stay motivated and on course. As you lose weight 
and gain better health, talk to your doctor about what additional activities you might be able to do and, 
if appropriate, how to give your activity and exercise a boost. 
You may always have to remain vigilant about your weight. Combining a healthier diet and more

Measuring Obesity 
From Calipers to CAT Scans, Ten Ways to Tell Whether a Body Is Fat or Lean 
What’s the best way to determine whether a body is fat or fit? Body fat can be measured in several 
ways, with each body fat assessment method having pros and cons. 
 
The most basic method, and the most common, is the body mass index (BMI). Doctors can 
easily calculate BMI from the heights and weights they gather at each checkup; BMI tables and 
online calculators also make it easy for individuals to determine their own BMIs. 
 
The BMI and other so-called “field methods”—among them, waist circumference, waist-to-hip 
ratio, skinfold thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance—are useful in clinics and community 
settings, as well as in large research studies. 
 
More sophisticated methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging or dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry, are so-called “reference measurements”—techniques that are typically only 
used in research studies to confirm the accuracy of (or as scientists say, to “validate”) body 
measurement techniques. 
 
Several methods can’t be used in children or pregnant women, due to safety concerns, or are 
less accurate in people who are very overweight.  
Here is a brief overview of some of the most popular methods for measuring body fat—from basic 
body measurements to high-tech body scans—along with their strengths and limitations.

 Body Mass Index (BMI) 
Body mass index (BMI) is the ratio of weight to height, calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2), or 
weight (lb)/height (in2) multiplied by 703. 
Strengths 
 
Easy to measure 
 
Inexpensive 
 
Standardized cutoff points for overweight and obesity: Normal weight is a BMI between 18.5 
and 24.9; overweight is a BMI between 25.0 and 29.9; obesity is a BMI of 30.0 or higher 
 
Strongly correlated with body fat levels, as measured by the most accurate methods 
 
Hundreds of studies show that a high BMI predicts higher risk of chronic disease and early 
death. 
Limitations 
 
Indirect and imperfect measurement—does not distinguish between body fat and lean body 
mass 
 
Not as accurate a predictor of body fat in the elderly as it is in younger and middle-aged adults 
 
At the same BMI, women have, on average, more body fat than men, and Asians have more 
body fat than whites 
Waist Circumference 
Waist circumference is the simplest and most common way to measure “abdominal obesity”—the extra 
fat found around the middle that is an important factor in health, even independent of BMI. It’s the 
circumference of the abdomen, measured at the natural waist (in between the lowest rib and the top of 
the hip bone), the umbilicus (belly button), or at the narrowest point of the midsection. 
Strengths 
 
Easy to measure 
 
Inexpensive 
 
Strongly correlated with body fat in adults as measured by the most accurate methods 
 
Studies show waist circumference predicts development of disease and death

Limitations 
 
Measurement procedure has not been standardized 
 
Lack of good comparison standards (reference data) for waist circumference in children 
 
May be difficult to measure and less accurate in individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher 
Waist-to-Hip Ratio 
Like the waist circumference, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is also used to measure abdominal obesity. 
It’s calculated by measuring the waist and the hip (at the widest diameter of the buttocks), and then 
dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement. 
Strengths 
 
Good correlation with body fat as measured by the most accurate methods 
 
Inexpensive 
 
Studies show waist-to-hip ratio predicts development of disease and death in adults 
Limitations 
 
More prone to measurement error because it requires two measurements 
 
More difficult to measure hip than it is to measure waist 
 
More complex to interpret than waist circumference, since increased waist-to-hip ratio can be 
caused by increased abdominal fat or decrease in lean muscle mass around the hips 
 
Turning the measurements into a ratio leads to a loss of information: Two people with very 
different BMIs could have the same WHR 
 
May be difficult to measure and less accurate in individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher 
Skin-fold Thickness 
In this method, researchers use a special caliper to measure the thickness of a “pinch” of skin and the 
fat beneath it in specific areas of the body (the trunk, the thighs, front and back of the upper arm, and 
under the shoulder blade). Equations are used to predict body fat percentage based on these 
measurements.

 
Convenient

Limitations 


Bioelectric Impedance (BIA) 
BIA equipment sends a small, imperceptible, safe electric current through the body, measuring he 
resistance. The current faces more resistance passing through body fat than it 
 does passing through lean body mass and water. Equations are used to estimate body fat percentage 
and fat-free mass.  
Strengths 
 
Convenient 
 
Safe 
 
Relatively inexpensive 
 
Portable 
 
Fast and easy 
Limitations 
 
Hard to calibrate 
 
The ratio of body water to fat may be change during illness, dehydration or weight loss, 
decreasing accuracy 
 
Not as accurate as other methods, especially in individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher 
Underwater Weighing (Densitometry) 
Individuals are weighed in air and while submerged in a tank. (1) Researchers use formulas to estimate 
body volume, body density, and body fat percentage. Fat is more buoyant (less dense) than water, so 
someone with high body fat will have a lower body density than someone with low body fat. This 
method is typically only used in a research setting.

Air-Displacement Plethysmography 
This method uses a similar principle to underwater weighing but can be done in the air instead of  
in water. Individuals sit in a small chamber wearing a bathing suit; one commercial example is the 
“Bod Pod.” The machine estimates body volume based on air pressure  
 
differences between the empty chamber and the occupied chamber. 
Strengths 
 
Relatively quick and comfortable 
 
Accurate 
 
Safe 
 
Good choice for children, older adults, pregnant women, individuals with a BMI of 40 or 
higher, and other individuals who would not want to be submerged in water 
Limitations 
 
Expensive 
Dilution Method (Hydrometry) 
Individuals drink isotope-labeled water and give body fluid samples. Researchers analyze these 
samples for isotope levels, which are then used to calculate total body water, fat-free body mass and in 
turn, body fat mass.  
Strengths 
 
Relatively low cost

Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) 
X-ray beams pass through different body tissues at different rates. So DEXA uses two low-level X-ray 
beams to develop estimates of fat-free mass, fat mass, and bone mineral density.  
DEXA is typically only used for this purpose in research settings. 
Strengths 
 
Accurate 
Limitations 
 
Equipment is expensive and cannot be moved 
 
Cannot accurately distinguish between different types of fat (fat under the skin, also known as 
“subcutaneous” fat vs. fat around the internal organs, or “visceral” fat) 
 
Cannot be used with pregnant women, since it requires exposure to a small dose of radiation 
 
Most current systems cannot accommodate individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher 
Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
These two imaging techniques are now considered to be the most accurate methods for  
measuring tissue, organ, and whole-body fat mass as well as lean muscle mass and bone mass.  
CT and MRI scans are typically only used for this purpose in research settings. 
Strengths

Child Obesity 
The World Health Organization (WHO) regards childhood obesity as one of the most serious global 
public health challenges for the 21st century. Obese children and adolescents are at an increased risk of 
developing various health problems, and are also more likely to become obese adults. 
Cause  
• 
Genetic Link  
– Multifactorial condition related to sedentary lifestyle, too much good intake and choice 
of foods actually alter genetic make-up, creating higher risk of obesity 
• 
Behavioral 
– Children will more likely choose heal thier foods if they are offered to them at young 
ages and in the home   
• 
Environment  
– In homes where healthy food is not available or the food choices are not healthy. 
Obesity can occur

Treatment 
Weight reduction is achieved by: 
 
Consuming fewer calories 
 
Increasing activity and exercise 
Structured approaches and therapies to reduce weight include: 
 
A modified diet. A reasonable weight loss goal is 1 to 2 pounds per week. This can usually be 
achieved by eating 500 to 1,000 fewer calories each day. Whether you concentrate on eating less fat 
or fewer carbohydrates is up to you. Fats have more than twice as many calories per ounce than 
 
34 
 
 
Anthropology 
 
 Physiology and Sports Anthropology 
 
 Obesity treatment, prevention and management 
 
 
 
carbohydrates or protein. If you cut out carbohydrates, you still need to limit fat intake. Choose 
healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated oils. 
 
Regular exercise. To effectively lose weight, most people need to do moderate intensity 
exercise for 60 minutes most days of the week. Add more activity during the day. Take the stairs 
and get up often from your desk or sofa. 
 
Non-prescription orlistat (Alli). Orlistat inhibits fat absorption in the intestine. Until recently, 
this medication was only available by prescription (Xenical). The over-the-counter medicine is sold 
at a lower dose than Xenical. But the active ingredient is the same. 
 
Other non-prescription diet pills. Over-the-counter diet pills often contain ingredients that 
can increase heart rate and blood pressure. It is not clear how effective they are in producing weight 
loss that can be maintained over time. Common side effects include feeling jittery and nervous and 
having heart palpitations. Some experts believe they may be associated with an increased risk of 
stroke. 
 
Prescription diet pills. To help you lose weight, your doctor may prescribe medications along 
with a calorie-restricted diet. Almost all people regain weight when they stop using these 
medications. The effects of long-term use of these drugs have not been determined. 
 
Surgery. In general, weight-loss surgery (called bariatric surgery) may be considered if your 
BMI is 40 or greater, or your BMI is 30-35 or greater and you have at least one medical condition 
directly related to obesity. In addition, you must have participated in a structured weight loss 
program without success. 
The more common types of surgical procedures include: 
o 
Gastroplasty – also known as stomach stapling. A surgeon creates a small pouch in the 
stomach that allows only limited amounts of food to be eaten at one time. 
o 
Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. A surgeon places an adjustable band 
around the stomach with minimally invasive surgery. 
 
Gastric bypass. This is the most effective weight loss surgery. However, it also carries a 
greater risk of complications, both short term and long term. A surgeon creates a small pouch in the 
upper part of the stomach. A hole is made in the small intestine beyond the normal stomach

attachment. The pouch is attached to the hole, bypassing the rest of the stomach and the top part of 
the small intestine.

Summary 
 
 
The need for prevention and management of obesity is at its highest the world over and it is 
very clear that a lot more needs to be done than what is prevailing today. 
 
 
 With the advent of technology and invasion of television, the problem of the average human 
being seems to have only increased.  
 
 
Though the role of genetics is high in determining the body weight of a person, his or her 
lifestyle is a great contributing factor too in the cause, management and prevention of obesity.  
 
 
People of earlier times had to do physical labor as machines and technologies did not dominate 
their lives. But, today all that has changed and everything seems to be at peoples reach just at 
the press of a button.  
 
 
Thus, the need to exert physically for day to day activities has significantly decreased and today 
people have to engage willfully or not so willfully in some kind of physical activities to keep a 
check on obesity and related diseases.  
 
 
Correspondingly the diet the people consume today is definitely not in proportion to the 
physical activity that we engage in. 
 
 
 Moreover, the concept of fast food is getting too popular that it seen as one of the major cause 
for explosion of obesity around the globe.  
 
 
Therefore, it is time for people to seriously contemplate on their lifestyles and choose how they 
could manage the epidemic of obesity to the best of their ability and health.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
People have become more and more inactive without corresponding adjustment in their calorific 
intake. This has lead to this serious problem and if not addressed in the war footing, we may never be 
able to reverse this trend. It is in the individual persons hands to make suitable adjustments in their 
respective lifestyles so that there can be effective management of this serious epidemic.

In the run-up to its Virtual Annual Meeting in September 2020 the European Association for the Study of 
Diabetes (EASD) launched a series of videos on its e-Learning platform with the catchy title of Around the 
Diabetes World in 80 Days [1]. The videos consisted of 3 to 4 minute messages from (clinical or research) 
leaders in diabetes care from 80 different countries around the world. The national representatives were 
asked to summarise the challenges and opportunities in diabetes care and research in their region. 
Common themes that ran through the series of video messages included (1) the need for accurate 
“counting” of individuals living with diabetes to facilitate proper organisation and delivery of services, (2) 
the challenge of identifying individuals living with undiagnosed diabetes, estimated to be between 30 and 
50% in some countries, (3) education of healthcare professionals (especially those in primary care) to 
deliver high quality diabetes care and (4) problems with inequality of access to services either by virtue of 
immigration status or due to lack of health insurance.
The first step in improving the quality of diabetes care at a national level is to be able to measure it 
accurately. The Euro Diabetes Index was a 2014 publication from a Scandinavian Clearinghouse in which 
the authors collected a set of data from 30 European countries with the intention of ranking them in 
terms of their approach to the organisation and delivery of diabetes care [2]. Similar to the themes from 
the EASD’s Around the Diabetes World in 80 days videos, the criteria on which rankings were based 
included (1) having a national or regional diabetes registry, (2) having an approach to screening or early 
detection of diabetes, (3) providing access to care for all people living with diabetes and (4) a set of 
measures of the outcomes of care delivered in that country. Countries that ranked highest in the Index 
tended to have national diabetes registries, a strong public health approach to the organisation of care 
and provided universal access to care. Countries that ranked lower down in the Index tended not to have 
some or all of these attributes.
Whatever challenges countries in Europe and North America face in improving the delivery of diabetes 
care, the scale of the challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is orders of magnitude greater 
[3,4]. A lack of resources for delivering diabetes care, inadequate training of healthcare professionals in 
diabetes care delivery and challenges with delivering education in self-management are just some of the 
issues faced in the LMIC setting. The paper by Nagpal and colleagues in the current issue highlights the 
scale of the problem in Delhi, the capital of India [5]. The authors conducted a rigorous epidemiological 
survey of a representative sample of residents from across all social classes. Baseline demographic data in 
over 850 individuals combined with fasting biochemical measures in 800 participants resulted in a 
comprehensive snapshot of the quality of diabetes care across the city. The results showed that very few 
participants had received standard measures such as HbA1c, Blood pressure and LDL Cholesterol (the so

called ABC’s of good diabetes care) in the previous 12 months. Even fewer had screening for retinopathy 
or foot problems. The biochemical measures showed that the majority of participants had glycaemic and 
lipid levels that were well above target.
The current study builds on an earlier report (using similar population-wide sampling methodology) by the 
same group which looked at the quality of diabetes care in middle and high income areas of Delhi where 
health insurance was common [6]. A strength of the current report was that the authors included the 
urban poor (mostly uninsured) as well as the urban wealthy (mostly insured). Thus, sub-optimal glycaemic 
control (HbA1c >10%; 42% in the earlier report vs 58% in the current study) and sub-optimal lipid control 
(LDL cholesterol >100 mg/dL; 30.9% in the earlier report vs 67.2% in the current study) were both 
increased. The percent of individuals with blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg reduced from 63.2% in the 
earlier report to 57.3% in the current study. Apart from the blood pressure findings most measures of the 
quality of diabetes care in Delhi deteriorated when compared to the survey undertaken 13 years earlier. 
While Delhi doesn’t have the problem of migrant population as a significant burden on its health care 
delivery system, virtual lack of health insurance makes out-of-pocket expenditure the only means to 
afford health care services. This represents an example of the Inverse Care Law (of Tudor Hart) which 
states that those members of society who most need healthcare are also the ones least likely to receive it. 
This topic and the related migration of rural to urban dwelling has been the subject of a recent 
commentary from the Public Health Foundation of India [7].
How do we interpret the findings of the Nagpal survey(s) and place them in the wider context of health 
and diabetes care in India? Indian health care systems face the double trouble of a rising burden of Non-
Communicable Diseases (NCDs), diabetes being one of them, while the communicable disease burden is 
yet to reach its nadir. In an attempt to deal with the rising burden of NCDs the Indian Government 
launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular 
Diseases, and Stroke in 2010, focusing on the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle, early diagnosis, 
and management [8]. Through Ayushman Bharat, the National Health Protection Mission, the government 
aims to establish 150,000 primary health care centres and to pay for health insurance for the people with 
low socioeconomic status who need it the most but are unable to afford it [9]. Given the large number of 
people with diabetes in India (80 million per current estimates), creating and maintaining a national 
diabetes registry is a tough task but eventually needs to be accomplished. While the importance of 
educating Indian primary health care physicians in the detection and treatment of diabetes is appreciated, 
recent (2019-20) Economic Survey data released by the Government of India reports a doctor:population 
ratio of 1:1456,  in stark contrast to the WHO recommendation of 1:1000, underpinning  a huge shortage

of primary care physicians in India.  Furthermore, unlike in the West, the concept of a diabetes specialist 
nurse is virtually non-existent in India. Training nurses to deliver preventive and therapeutic diabetes care 
may go a long way to improving the overall quality of diabetes care. 
In his book, “In Search of the Perfect Health System”, Mark Britnell, an expert on global healthcare 
systems, describes some of the challenges faced by countries in organising healthcare for their citizens 
[10]. These include ageing populations, increasing prevalence of chronic disease and problems with 
integrating care between primary and secondary care. Acknowledging that the perfect health system does 
not exist, Britnell imagines what it might look like if it did exist and goes on to describe strengths of many 
health systems including some from LMIC (see Table). Take home messages from Britnell’s review of 26 
different national healthcare systems include (1) that you don’t have a health system imposed on you; 
your health system reflects you (as a society) and (2) that while healthcare professionals are key to 
delivering care, socio-political factors are usually the drivers of change in health systems and healthcare 
delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted this with fundamental changes occurring in the 
organisation and delivery of care in many countries. Not only was the scale of the change impressive but 
the speed at which it occurred was often weeks or months where previously it might have taken years or 
decades. Telemedicine, rapid vaccine approval, population wide behaviour change are just some 
examples of these widespread changes (many still happening) in countries around the world. Another 
lesson from (the communicable disease) COVID-19 that is perhaps relevant to (the non-communicable 
disease) diabetes is the importance of a strong public health approach to the organisation and delivery of 
care including efforts to prevent diabetes both at the individual and at the whole population level [11]. 
When the dust settles on the COVID-19 pandemic hopefully some of this learning can be applied to 
improving diabetes care in wealthy countries and LMIC alike.

Advance praise for The Diabetes Code
“By understanding the underlying cause of the disease, Dr. Fung reveals
how [type 2 diabetes] can be prevented and also reversed using natural
dietary methods instead of medications. This is an important and timely
book. Highly recommended.”
MARK HYMAN, MD, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Eat?
“With rich scientific support, Dr. Jason Fung has sounded a clarion call to
re-evaluate how we view and treat diabetes. Considering that roughly half
of all adults worldwide are diabetic or on their way (pre-diabetes), The
Diabetes Code is essential reading.”
DR. BENJAMIN BIKMAN, Associate Professor of Physiology, Brigham Young University
“In The Diabetes Code, Dr. Fung lays out the case for eliminating sugar
and refined carbohydrates and replacing them with whole foods with
healthy fats. Dr. Fung gives an easy-to-follow solution to reversing type 2
diabetes by addressing the root cause, diet.”
MARIA EMMERICH, author of The 30-Day Ketogenic Cleanse
“In this terrific and hopeful book, Dr. Fung teaches you everything you
need to know about how to reverse type 2 diabetes. It could change the
world.”
DR. ANDREAS EENFELDT, author of Low Carb, High Fat Food Revolution
“The Diabetes Code should be on the bookshelf of every physician and
any patient struggling with blood sugar control.”
CARRIE DIULUS, MD, medical director of the Crystal Clinic Spine Wellness Center
“The Diabetes Code is unabashedly provocative yet practical . . . a clear

FOREWORD
IN JUST A generation, diabetes has gone from rarity to epidemic, a
catastrophic turn that presents urgent questions: Why are so many
suffering, and so suddenly? And how have our health authorities failed to
offer an explanation or treatment for so devastating a scourge, despite
spending billions? They have, instead, essentially given up on finding a
cure, pronouncing type 2 diabetes1 a chronic, progressive disease that
promises a life of slow, painful decline and early death.
Tragically, diabetes authorities worldwide have come to the
consensus that the best hope for sufferers is merely to control or delay
the disease through a lifelong dependence on medications combined with
medical devices and surgery. There is no emphasis on better nutrition.
Instead, some forty-five international medical and scientific societies and
associations around the world declared in 2016 that bariatric surgery,
which is both expensive and risky, should be the first option for diabetes
treatment. Another recently approved idea is a new weight-loss
procedure in which a thin tube, implanted in the stomach, ejects food
from the body before all the calories can be absorbed, which some have
termed “medically sanctioned bulimia.” And all this is in addition to the
basic regimen for diabetes sufferers: multiple medications, which cost
hundreds of dollars a month, and which include insulin, a drug that
paradoxically often causes weight gain.
These techniques for managing diabetes are expensive, invasive, and
do nothing to reverse diabetes—because, as Dr. Jason Fung explains in
The Diabetes Code, “you can’t use drugs [or devices] to cure a dietary
disease.”
The groundbreaking idea Dr. Fung presents in these pages is that
diabetes is caused by our bodies’ insulin response to chronic
overconsumption of carbohydrates and that the best and most natural
way to reverse the disease is to reduce consumption of those
carbohydrates. A low-carbohydrate diet for treating obesity is not only
being practiced now by hundreds of doctors around the world but is
supported by more than seventy-five clinical trials, conducted on
altogether thousands of people, including several trials of two years’
duration, which establish the diet as safe and effective.
Remarkably, the practice of carbohydrate restriction for diabetes
dates back more than a century, when the diet was considered standard
treatment. According to a 1923 medical text by the “father of modern
medicine,” Sir William Osler, the disease could be defined as one in
which “the normal utilization of carbohydrate is impaired.” Yet soon
thereafter, when pharmaceutical insulin became available, that advice
changed, allowing a higher-carbohydrate intake to again become the
norm.
Osler’s idea would not be revived until science journalist Gary Taubes
unearthed and developed it into a comprehensive intellectual framework
for the “carbohydrate-insulin” hypothesis, in his seminal 2007 book Good
Calories, Bad Calories. And the modern-day clinical model for diabetics
was set forth by scientists Stephen D. Phinney and Jeff S. Volek, as well
as the physician Richard K. Bernstein.2
In an exciting recent development, clinical trial evidence specifically
on diabetics is now emerging. As of this writing, at least one trial,
involving some 330 people, is underway for the treatment of the disease
with a very low-carbohydrate diet. At the one-year mark, researchers
found that some 97 percent of patients had reduced or halted their insulin
use, and 58 percent no longer had a formal diagnosis of diabetes.3 In
other words, these patients successfully reversed their diabetes simply
by restricting carbohydrates—findings that ought to be compared to the
official standard of care for diabetics, which states with 100 percent
certainty that the condition is “irreversible.”
Dr. Fung, a practicing nephrologist who gained renown by introducing
intermittent fasting for the control of obesity, is a passionate and
articulate proponent of the low-carbohydrate approach. In addition to his
fascinating insights, he has a gift for explaining complex science clearly
and delivering it with the perfect, telling anecdote. One never forgets, for
instance, the image of Japanese rush-hour commuters being shoved into
overstuffed subways cars as a metaphor for excessive circulating
glucose packed into each and every corporeal cell. We get the point: the
body cannot handle so much glucose! Dr. Fung explains the relationship
between glucose and insulin and how these together drive not only
obesity and diabetes but also, quite likely, a host of other related chronic
diseases as well.
The obvious question is why this low-carbohydrate approach is not
more widely known. Indeed, in the six months prior to my writing this
foreword, major review articles on obesity appeared in such respected
publications as the New York Times, Scientific American, and Time
magazine, yet among the thousands of words written, there was barely a
mention of the word that can explain so much: insulin. This oversight is
perplexing but is also, unfortunately, the reflection of genuine bias
pervading an expert community that has for half a century endorsed a
very different approach.
That approach, of course, has been to count calories and avoid fat. In
recent years, authorities including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and
Department of Health and Human Services, which jointly publish Dietary
Guidelines for Americans, as well as the American Heart Association,
have backed off the “low-fat” diet, yet they still believe weight control can
be explained by little more than a model of Calories In, Calories Out. A
good deal of rigorous science debunks this notion, and the epidemics of
chronic disease have not, to date, been curbed by it, but its captivating
simplicity and widespread expert support allow it to endure.
There is also the stark reality that most medical associations today
are significantly funded by pharmaceutical and device companies, which
have no interest in a dietary solution to disease. Indeed, a nutritional fix
that reverses disease and ends the need for medication puts them
squarely out of business. This must explain why attendees at recent
annual meetings of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have
reported that amidst a sea of presentations on medical devices and
surgeries, there’s a near-complete absence of any information on low-
carbohydrate diets. And this fact must explain why, when the medical
directors of two obesity clinics (including one at Harvard University) wrote
an op-ed published in the New York Times about the lack of discussion
on diet at the 2016 ADA conference, the ADA itself shot them down.4 One
might assume also that, in addition to financial conflicts of interest, the
cognitive dissonance must be overwhelming for experts confronting
information implying that their knowledge and advice of the past fifty
years is simply wrong. In fact, more than wrong: harmful.
For this is the unvarnished truth: the success of carbohydrate
restriction directly implies that the last several decades of low-fat, high-
carbohydrate nutrition advice has almost certainly fueled the very obesity
and diabetes epidemics it was intended to prevent. This is a devastating
conclusion to half a century of public health efforts, but if we are to have
any hope of reversing these epidemics, we must accept this possibility,
begin to explore the alternative science contained in this book, and start
on a new path forward—for the sake of truth, science, and better health.

HOW TO REVERSE AND PREVENT
TYPE 2 DIABETES:
THE QUICK START GUIDE
THIRTY YEARS AGO, home electronics, such as a brand new VCR, came with
a thick instruction manual. “Read thoroughly before proceeding,” it
implored, and then launched into detailed setup procedures and
troubleshooting guides that painstakingly described everything that could
possibly go wrong. Most of us ignored this manual, plugged in our new
purchase, and then tried to figure out the rest when the time clock began
to blink 12:00.
Today, new electronics come with a quick start guide that outlines a
few basic steps to get your machine working. Everything else is still
referenced in a detailed instruction manual, now often found online, but
there’s really no need to consult it until you want your machine to perform
more complex functions. Instruction manuals are just so much more
useful this way.
Consider this section of the book the quick start guide for reversing
and preventing type 2 diabetes. It’s a brief introduction to the disease:
what it is, why conventional treatment approaches don’t work, and what
you can do today to start effectively managing your health.
FACT: TYPE 2 DIABETES IS FULLY REVERSIBLE AND PREVENTABLE
MOST HEALTH PROFESIONALS consider type 2 diabetes to be a chronic and
progressive disease. This promotes the idea that type 2 diabetes is a
one-way street, a life sentence with no possibility of parole: the disease
continually gets worse until you eventually require insulin injections.
But this is actually a great big lie, which is excellent news for anyone
who has been diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.
Recognizing the fallacy of this belief is the crucial first step in reversing
the disease. Actually, most people already instinctively recognize this. It’s
ridiculously easy to prove that type 2 diabetes is almost always
reversible.
Suppose you have a friend who is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes,
meaning the level of glucose in his blood is continuously above normal
levels. He works hard to lose 50 pounds, which enables him to stop
taking his glucose-lowering medications because the levels in his blood
are now normal. What would you say to him? Probably something like
“Great job. You’re really taking care of yourself. Keep it up!”
What you wouldn’t say is something like “You’re such a filthy liar. My
doctor says this is a chronic and progressive disease so you must be
lying.” It seems perfectly obvious that the diabetes reversed because
your friend lost all that weight. And that’s the point: type 2 diabetes is a
reversible disease.
We’ve intuitively sensed this truth all along. But only diet and lifestyle
changes—not medications—will reverse this disease, simply because
type 2 diabetes is largely a dietary disease. The most important
determinant, of course, is weight loss. Most of the medications used to
treat type 2 diabetes do not cause weight loss. Quite the contrary. Insulin,
for example, is notorious for causing weight gain. Once patients start on
insulin injections for type 2 diabetes, they often sense they are heading
down the wrong path.
My diabetic patients would often say, “Doctor, you’ve always said
weight loss is the key to reversing diabetes. Yet you prescribed me a
drug that made me gain 25 pounds. How is that good?” I never had a
satisfactory answer to this important question because none existed. The
plain truth was that it was not good. The key to treating diabetes properly
was weight loss. Logically, because it caused weight gain, insulin was not
making things better; it was actually making the disease worse.
Since weight loss is the key to reversing type 2 diabetes, medications
don’t help. We only pretend they do, which is the reason most doctors
think type 2 diabetes is chronic and progressive. We’ve avoided facing an
inconvenient truth: drugs won’t cure a dietary disease. They are about as
useful as bringing a snorkel to a bicycle race. The problem is not the
disease; the problem is the way we treat the disease.
The same principles used for reversing type 2 diabetes also apply to
preventing it. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are closely related, and
generally, increased weight increases the risk of disease. The correlation
is not perfect but, nevertheless, maintaining an ideal weight is a first step
to prevention.
Many people paint type 2 diabetes as an inevitable part of modern
life, but this is simply not true. The epidemic of type 2 diabetes really only
started in the late 1980s. So we only need to go back a single generation
to find a way of life that can prevent most incidents of this disease.
FACT: TYPE 2 DIABETES IS CAUSED BY TOO MUCH SUGAR
AT ITS VERY core, type 2 diabetes can be understood as a disease caused
by too much insulin, which our bodies secrete when we eat too much
sugar. Framing the problem this way is incredibly powerful because the
solution becomes immediately obvious. We must lower our insulin levels
by reducing our dietary intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates (a form
of sugar).
Imagine your body as a big sugar bowl. At birth, the bowl is empty.
Over several decades, you eat sugar and refined carbohydrates and the
bowl gradually fills up. When you next eat, sugar comes in and spills over
the sides of the bowl because the bowl is already full.
The same situation exists in your body. When you eat sugar, your
body secretes the hormone insulin to help move the sugar into your cells,
where it’s used for energy. If you don’t burn off that sugar sufficiently, then
over decades your cells become completely filled and cannot handle any
more. The next time you eat sugar, insulin cannot force any more of it
into your overflowing cells, so it spills out into the blood. Sugar travels in
your blood in a form called glucose, and having too much of it—known as
high blood glucose—is a primary symptom of type 2 diabetes.
When there’s too much glucose in the blood, insulin does not appear
to be doing its usual job of moving the sugar into the cells. We then say
that the body has become insulin resistant, but it’s not truly insulin’s fault.
The primary problem is that the cells are overflowing with glucose. The
high blood glucose is only part of the issue. Not only is there too much
glucose in the blood, there’s too much glucose in all of the cells. Type 2
diabetes is simply an overflow phenomenon that occurs when there is too
much glucose in the entire body.
In response to excess glucose in the blood, the body secretes even
more insulin to overcome this resistance. This forces more glucose into
the overflowing cells to keep blood levels normal. This works, but the
effect is only temporary because it has not addressed the problem of
excess sugar; it has only moved the excess from the blood to the cells,
making insulin resistance worse. At some point, even with more insulin,
the body cannot force any more glucose into the cells.
Think about packing a suitcase. At first, the clothes go into the empty
suitcase without any trouble. Once the suitcase is full, however, it
becomes difficult to jam in those last two T-shirts. You reach a point
where you can’t close the suitcase. You could say the luggage appears to
be resisting the clothes. This is similar to the overflow phenomenon we
see in our cells.
Once that suitcase is full, you might simply use more force to shove
those last T-shirts in. This strategy will only work temporarily, because
you have not addressed the underlying problem of the overfilled suitcase.
As you force more shirts into the suitcase, the problem—let’s call it
luggage resistance—only becomes worse. The better solution is to
remove some of the clothes from the suitcase.
What happens in the body if we do not remove the excess glucose?
First, the body keeps increasing the amount of insulin it produces to try to
force more glucose into the cells. But this only creates more insulin
resistance, in what then becomes a vicious cycle. When the insulin levels
can no longer keep pace with rising resistance, blood glucose spikes.
That’s when your doctor is likely to diagnose type 2 diabetes.
Your doctor may prescribe a medication such as insulin injections, or
perhaps a drug called metformin, to lower blood glucose, but these drugs
do not rid the body of excess glucose. Instead, they simply continue to
take the glucose out of the blood and ram it back into the body. It then
gets shipped out to other organs, such as the kidneys, the nerves, the
eyes, and the heart, where it can eventually create other problems. The
underlying problem, of course, is unchanged.
Remember the bowl that was overflowing with sugar? It still is. Insulin
has simply moved the glucose from the blood, where you could see it,
into the body, where you cannot. So the very next time you eat, sugar
spills out into the blood again and you inject insulin to cram it into your
body. Whether you think of it as an overstuffed suitcase or an overflowing
bowl, it’s the same phenomenon all over again.
The more glucose you force your body to accept, the more insulin
your body needs to overcome the resistance to it. But this insulin only
creates more resistance as the cells become more and more distended.
Once you’ve exceeded what your body can produce naturally,
medications can take over. At first, you need only a single medication, but
eventually it becomes two and then three, and the doses become larger.
And here’s the thing: if you are taking more and more medications to
keep your blood glucose at the same level, your diabetes is actually
getting worse.
Conventional diabetes treatments: How to make the problems
worse
THE BLOOD GLUCOSE got better with insulin, but the diabetes got worse. The
medications only hid the blood glucose by cramming it into the already
engorged cells. The diabetes looks better but actually it is worse.
Doctors may congratulate themselves on the illusion of a job well
done, even as patients get sicker. No amount of medication prevents the
heart attacks, congestive heart failure, strokes, kidney failure,
amputations, and blindness that result when diabetes is getting worse.
“Oh well,” the doctor says, “it’s a chronic, progressive disease.”
Here’s an analogy. Consider that hiding garbage under your bed
instead of discarding it allows you to pretend that your house is clean.
When there’s no more room under the bed, you can throw the garbage
into the closet. In fact, you can hide it anywhere you can’t see it: in the
basement, in the attic, even in the bathroom. But if you keep hiding your
garbage, eventually it’s going to begin to smell really, really bad because
it’s starting to rot. Instead of hiding it, you need to throw it out.
If the solution to your overflowing suitcase and your overflowing
house seems obvious, the solution to too much glucose, which leads to
too much insulin, should also seem self-evident: Get rid of it! But the
standard treatment for type 2 diabetes follows the same flawed logic of
hiding the glucose instead of eliminating it. If we understand that too
much glucose in the blood is toxic, why can’t we understand that too
much glucose in the body is also toxic?
FACT: TYPE 2 DIABETES AFFECTS EVERY ORGAN IN THE BODY
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN excessive glucose piles up in the body over ten or
twenty years? Every cell in the body starts to rot, which is precisely why
type 2 diabetes, unlike virtually any other disease, affects every single
organ. Your eyes rot, and you go blind. Your kidneys rot, and you need
dialysis. Your heart rots, and you get heart attacks and heart failure. Your
brain rots, and you get Alzheimer’s disease. Your liver rots, and you get
fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. Your legs rot, and you get diabetic foot
ulcers. Your nerves rot, and you get diabetic neuropathy. No part of your
body is spared.
Standard medications do not prevent the progression of organ failure
because they do not help excrete the toxic sugar load. No less than
seven multinational, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials
have proved that standard medications that lower blood glucose do not
reduce heart disease, the major killer of diabetic patients. We have
pretended that these glucose-lowering medications make people
healthier, but it’s been a lie. We have overlooked a singular truth: you
can’t use drugs to cure a dietary disease.
FACT: TYPE 2 DIABETES IS REVERSIBLE AND PREVENTABLE WITHOUT MEDICATIONS
ONCE WE UNDERSTAND that type 2 diabetes is simply too much sugar in the
body, the solution becomes obvious. Get rid of the sugar. Don’t hide it
away. Get rid of it. There are really only two ways to accomplish this.
1. Put less sugar in.
2. Burn off remaining sugar.
That’s it. That’s all we need to do. The best part? It’s all natural and
completely free. No drugs. No surgery. No cost.
Step 1: Put less sugar in
THE FIRST STEP is to eliminate all sugar and refined carbohydrates from
your diet. Added sugars have no nutritional value and you can safely
withhold them. Complex carbohydrates, which are simply long chains of
sugars, and highly refined carbohydrates, such as flour, are quickly
digested into glucose. The optimum strategy is to limit or eliminate
breads and pastas made from white flour, as well as white rice and
potatoes.
You should maintain a moderate, not high, intake of protein. When it
is digested, dietary protein, such as meat, breaks down into amino acids.
Adequate protein is required for good health, but excess amino acids
cannot be stored in the body and so the liver converts them into glucose.
Therefore, eating too much protein adds sugar to the body. So you
should avoid highly processed, concentrated protein sources such as
protein shakes, protein bars, and protein powders.
What about dietary fat? Natural fats, such as those found in
avocados, nuts, and olive oil—major components of the Mediterranean
diet—have a minimal effect on blood glucose or insulin and are well
known to have healthy effects on both heart disease and diabetes. Eggs
and butter are also excellent sources of natural fats. Dietary cholesterol,
which is often associated with these foods, has been shown to have no
harmful effect on the human body. Eating dietary fat does not lead to type
2 diabetes or heart disease. In fact, it is beneficial because it helps you
feel full without adding sugar to the body.
To put less sugar into your body, stick to whole, natural, unprocessed
foods. Eat a diet low in refined carbohydrates, moderate in protein, and
high in natural fats.
Step 2: Burn off remaining sugar
EXERCISE—BOTH RESISTANCE AND aerobic training—can have a beneficial
effect on type 2 diabetes, but it is far less powerful at reversing the
disease than dietary interventions. And fasting is the simplest and surest
method to force your body to burn sugar.
Fasting is merely the flip side of eating: if you are not eating, you are
fasting. When you eat, your body stores food energy; when you fast, your
body burns food energy. And glucose is the most easily accessible
source of food energy. Therefore, if you lengthen your periods of fasting,
you can burn off the stored sugar.
While it may sound severe, fasting is literally the oldest dietary
therapy known and has been practiced throughout human history without
problems. If you are taking prescription medications, you should seek the
advice of a physician. But the bottom line is this:
If you don’t eat, will your blood glucose come down? Of course.
If you don’t eat, will you lose weight? Of course.
So, what’s the problem? None that I can see.
To burn off sugar, a popular strategy is to fast for 24 hours, two to
three times per week. Another popular approach is to fast for 16 hours,
five to six times per week.
The secret to reversing type 2 diabetes now lies within our grasp. All it
requires is having an open mind to accept a new paradigm and the
courage to challenge conventional wisdom. You know the basics and are
ready to get started. But to really understand why type 2 diabetes is an
epidemic and what you can do to effectively manage your own health,
read on. Good luck.
HOW TYPE 2 DIABETES
BECAME AN EPIDEMIC
THE WORLD HEALTH Organization released its first global report on diabetes
in 2016 and the news was not good. Diabetes was an unrelenting
disaster. Since 1980—a single generation—the number of people around
the world afflicted with diabetes has quadrupled. How did this ancient
disease suddenly become the twenty-first-century plague?
A SHORT HISTORY OF DIABETES
THE DISEASE OF diabetes mellitus (DM) has been recognized for thousands
of years. The ancient Egyptian medical text, Ebers Papyrus, written
around 1550 BC, first described this condition of “passing too much
urine.”1 Around the same time, ancient Hindu writings discussed the
disease of madhumeha, which loosely translated means “honey urine.”2
Afflicted patients, often children, were mysteriously, inexorably losing
weight. Attempts to stop the wasting were unsuccessful despite continual
feeding, and the disease was almost uniformly fatal. Curiously, ants were
attracted to the urine, which was inexplicably sweet.
By 250 BC, the Greek physician Apollonius of Memphis had termed
the condition diabetes, which by itself connotes only excessive urination.
Thomas Willis added the term mellitus, meaning “from honey” in 1675.
This descriptor distinguishes diabetes mellitus from a different,
uncommon disease known as diabetes insipidus. Most commonly caused
by traumatic brain injury, diabetes insipidus is also characterized by
excessive urination, but the urine is not sweet. Fittingly, insipidus means
“bland.”
Colloquially, the non-specific term diabetes refers to diabetes mellitus
since it is far, far more common than diabetes insipidus. In this book, the
term diabetes only refers to diabetes mellitus, and there will be no further
discussion of diabetes insipidus.
In the first century AD, the Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia
wrote the classic description of type 1 diabetes as a “melting down of
flesh and limbs into urine.” This summary captures the essential feature
of this disease in its untreated form: excessive urine production is
accompanied by almost complete wasting away of all tissues. Patients
cannot gain weight no matter what they eat. Aretaeus further commented
that “life (with diabetes) is short, disgusting and painful” as there was no
effective treatment. Once affected, patients followed a predestined, fatal
course.
Tasting the urine of the stricken patient for sweetness was the classic
diagnostic test for diabetes (ewww. . .). In 1776, the English physician
Matthew Dobson (1732–1784) identified sugar as the substance causing
this characteristic sweet taste. The sweetness was found not only in the
urine, but also in the blood. Slowly, an understanding of diabetes was
unfolding, but a solution was still out of reach.
In 1797, the Scottish military surgeon John Rollo became the first
physician to formulate a treatment that carried any reasonable
expectation of success. He had observed substantial improvement in a
diabetic patient eating an all-meat diet. Given the uniformly grim
prognosis of diabetes, this approach was a breakthrough. This extremely
low carbohydrate diet was the first diabetic treatment of its kind.
By contrast, French physician Pierre Piorry (1794–1879) advised
diabetics to eat large quantities of sugar to replace what they lost in their
urine. While the logic seemed reasonable at the time, it was not a
successful strategy. A diabetic colleague unfortunate enough to follow
this advice later died, and history now only laughs at the good Dr. Piorry.3
However, this outcome foretold the grim shades of our own highly
ineffective advice to follow a high-carbohydrate diet in the treatment of
type 2 diabetes.
Apollinaire Bouchardat (1806–1886), who is sometimes called the
founder of modern diabetology, established his own therapeutic diet
based on the observation that periodic starvation during the Franco-
Prussian War of 1870 reduced urinary glucose. His book, De la
Glycosurie ou diabète sucré (Glycosuria or Diabetes Mellitus) laid out his
comprehensive dietary strategy, which forbade all foods high in sugars
and starches.
In 1889, Dr. Josef von Mering and Oskar Minkowski at the University
of Strasbourg experimentally removed a dog’s pancreas, the comma-
shaped organ between the stomach and intestine. The dog began to
urinate frequently, which Dr. von Mering astutely recognized as a
symptom of underlying diabetes. Testing the urine confirmed the high
sugar content.
In 1910, Sir Edward Sharpey-Schafer, sometimes regarded as the
founder of endocrinology (the study of hormones), proposed that the
deficiency of a single hormone he called insulin was responsible for
diabetes. The word insulin came from the Latin insula, which means
“island,” as this hormone is produced in cells called the islets of
Langerhans in the pancreas.
By the turn of the twentieth century, prominent American physicians
Frederick Madison Allen (1879–1964) and Elliott Joslin (1869–1962)
became strong proponents of intensive dietary management for diabetes,
given the lack of other useful treatments.
Dr. Allen envisioned diabetes as a disease in which the overstrained
pancreas could no longer keep up with the demands of an excessive
diet.4 To give the pancreas a rest, he prescribed the “Allen starvation
treatment,” which was very low in calories (1000 calories per day) and
very restricted in carbohydrates (<10g per day). Patients were admitted
to hospital and given only whiskey and black coffee every two hours from
7 a.m. to 7 p.m. This regime continued daily until the sugar disappeared
from the urine. Why was whiskey included? It was not essential, but was
administered simply because it “keeps the patient comfortable while he is
being starved.”5
The response of some patients was unlike anything seen previously.
They improved instantly and almost miraculously. Others, however,
starved to death, which was euphemistically called inanition.
A lack of understanding of the difference between type 1 and type 2
diabetes severely hampered the usefulness of Allen’s treatment. Type 1
diabetic patients were usually dramatically underweight children, whereas
type 2 diabetic patients were mostly overweight adults. This ultra-low
calorie diet could be deadly for the very malnourished type 1 diabetic
(more on the differences between these two types of diabetes below and
in chapter 2). Given the otherwise fatal prognosis of untreated type 1
diabetes, this was not the tragedy it may at first have appeared to be.
Allen’s detractors pejoratively called his treatments starvation diets, but
they were widely considered the best therapy, dietary or otherwise, until
the discovery of insulin in 1921.
Dr. Elliott P. Joslin opened his practice in 1898 in Boston after
receiving his medical degree from Harvard Medical School, becoming the
first American doctor to specialize in diabetes. Harvard University’s
eponymous Joslin Diabetes Center is still considered one of the foremost
diabetes institutes in the world, and the textbook Joslin wrote, The
Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus, is considered the bible of diabetes care.
Joslin himself is likely the most famous diabetologist in history.
Although Dr. Joslin had lost many patients to diabetes, he had also
saved many by applying Dr. Allen’s treatments. In 1916, he wrote: “That
temporary periods of under-nutrition are helpful in the treatment of
diabetes will probably be acknowledged by all after these two years of
experience with fasting.”6 He felt the improvements were so obvious to
everybody involved that studies would not even be necessary to prove
the point.
THE DISCOVERY OF THE CENTURY
FREDERICK BANTING, CHARLES Best, and John Macleod made the
breakthrough discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921.
They isolated insulin from the pancreases of cows and, with James
Collip, found a way to purify it enough to administer it to the first patient in
1922.7 Leonard Thompson, a fourteen-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes,
weighed only sixty-five pounds when he started insulin injections. His
symptoms and signs rapidly disappeared and he immediately regained a
normal weight. They quickly treated six more patients with equally
stunning success. The average lifespan of a ten-year-old at diagnosis
increased from about sixteen months8 to thirty-five years!
Eli Lilly and Company partnered with the University of Toronto to
commercially develop this revolutionary new drug, insulin. The patent
was made freely available so the entire world could benefit from the
medical discovery of the century. By 1923, 25,000 patients were being
treated with injected insulin, and Banting and Macleod received the Nobel
Prize for Physiology or Medicine.
Euphoria ensued. With the momentous discovery of insulin, it was
widely believed diabetes had finally been cured. British biochemist
Frederick Sanger determined the molecular structure of human insulin,
which garnered him the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and paved the
way for the biosynthesis and commercial production of this hormone.
Insulin’s discovery overshadowed the dietary treatments of the previous
century, essentially throwing them into general disrepute. Unfortunately,
the story of diabetes did not end there.
It soon became clear that different types of diabetes mellitus existed.
In 1936, Sir Harold Percival Himsworth (1905–1993) categorized
diabetics based on their insulin sensitivity.9 He’d noted that some patients
were exquisitely sensitive to the effects of insulin, but others were not.
Giving insulin to the insulin-insensitive group did not produce the
expected effect: instead of lowering blood glucose efficiently, the insulin
seemed to have little effect. By 1948, Joslin speculated that many people
had undiagnosed diabetes due to insulin resistance.10
By 1959, the two different types of diabetes were formally recognized:
type 1, or insulin-dependent diabetes, and type 2, or non-insulin
dependent diabetes. These terms were not entirely accurate, as many
type 2 patients are also prescribed insulin. By 2003, the terms insulin-
dependent and non-insulin dependent were abandoned, leaving only the
names type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
The names juvenile diabetes and adult-onset diabetes have also been
applied, to emphasize the distinction in the age of patients when the
disease typically begins. However, as type 1 is increasingly prevalent in
adults and type 2 is increasingly prevalent in children, these
classifications have also been abandoned.
THE ROOTS OF THE EPIDEMIC
IN THE 1950s, seemingly healthy Americans were developing heart attacks
with growing regularity. All great stories need a villain, and dietary fat was
soon cast into that role. Dietary fat was falsely believed to increase blood
cholesterol levels, leading to heart disease. Physicians advocated lower-
fat diets, and the demonization of dietary fat began in earnest. The
problem, though we didn’t see it at the time, was that restricting dietary
fats meant increasing dietary carbohydrates, as both create a feeling of
satiety (fullness). In the developed world, these carbohydrates tended to
be highly refined.
By 1968, the United States government had formed a committee to
look into the issue of hunger and malnutrition across the country and
recommend solutions to these problems. A report released in 1977,
called Dietary Goals for the United States, led to the 1980 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans. These guidelines included several specific
dietary goals, such as raising carbohydrate consumption to 55–60
percent of the diet and decreasing fat consumption from approximately
40 percent of calories to 30 percent.
Although the low-fat diet was originally proposed to reduce the risk of
heart disease and stroke, recent evidence refutes the link between
cardiovascular disease and total dietary fat. Many high-fat foods, such as
avocados, nuts, and olive oil, contain mono- and polyunsaturated fats
that are now believed to be heart-healthy. (The most recent Dietary
Guidelines for Americans released in 2016 have removed restrictions on
total dietary fat in a healthy diet.11)
Similarly, the link between natural, saturated fat and heart disease
has been proven false.12 While artificially saturated fats, such as trans
fats, are universally accepted as toxic, the same does not hold true for
naturally occurring fats found in meat and dairy products, such as butter,
cream, and cheese—foods that have been part of the human diet for time
beyond memory.
As it turns out, the consequences of this newfangled, unproven, low-
fat, high-carbohydrate diet were unintended: the rate of obesity soon
turned upwards and has never looked back.
The 1980 Dietary Guidelines spawned the infamous food pyramid in
all its counterfactual glory. Without any scientific evidence, the formerly
“fattening” carbohydrate was reborn as a healthy whole grain. The foods
that formed the base of the pyramid—foods we were told to eat every
single day—included breads, pastas, and potatoes. These were the
precise foods we had previously avoided in order to stay thin. They are
also the precise foods that provoke the greatest rise in blood glucose and
insulin.
Figure 1.1. Obesity trends in the U.S. after introduction of the “food pyramid” 13
As Figure 1.1 shows, obesity increased immediately. Ten years later,
as Figure 1.2 shows, diabetes began its inevitable rise. Age-adjusted
prevalence is still rising precipitously. In 1980, an estimated 108 million
people worldwide suffered with diabetes. By 2014, that number had
swelled to 422 million.14 Even more concerning is the fact that there
seems to be no end in sight.
THE TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY PLAGUE
DIABETES HAS INCREASED significantly in both sexes, every age group, every
racial and ethnic group, and all education levels. Type 2 diabetes attacks
younger and younger patients. Pediatric clinics, once the sole domain of
type 1 diabetes, are now overrun with an epidemic of obese adolescents
with type 2 diabetes.15
This is not merely a North American epidemic, but a worldwide
phenomenon, although close to 80 percent of the world’s adult diabetics
live in developing nations.17 Rates of diabetes are rising fastest in the
low- and middle-income nations of the world. In Japan, 80 percent of all
new cases of diabetes are type 2.
Figure 1.2. The rising tide of diabetes in the United States16
China, in particular, is a diabetes catastrophe. In 2013, an estimated
11.6 percent of Chinese adults had type 2 diabetes, eclipsing even the
long-time champion, the U.S., at 11.3 percent.18 Since 2007, 22 million
Chinese—a number close to the population of Australia—have been
newly diagnosed with diabetes. This number is even more shocking
when you consider that only 1 percent of Chinese had type 2 diabetes in
1980. In a single generation, the diabetes rate has risen by a horrifying
1160 percent. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the
worldwide rate of diabetes will reach 1 in every 10 adults by the year
2040.19
The problem is not trivial. In the U.S., 14.3 percent of adults have type
2 diabetes and 38 percent of the population has prediabetes, totaling
52.3 percent. This means that, for the first time in history, more people
have the disease than not. Prediabetes and diabetes is the new normal.
Worse, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased only in the last
forty years, making it clear that this is not some genetic disease or part of
the normal aging process but a lifestyle issue.
It is estimated that, in 2012, diabetes cost $245 billion in the United
States due to direct health costs and lost productivity.20 The medical
costs associated with treating diabetes and all its complications are two
to five times higher than treating nondiabetics. Already, the World Health
Organization estimates that 15 percent of annual health budgets
worldwide are spent on diabetes-related diseases. Those numbers
threaten to bankrupt entire nations.
The combination of prohibitive economic and social costs, increasing
prevalence, and younger age of onset make obesity and type 2 diabetes
the defining epidemics of this century. Ironically, despite the explosion of
medical knowledge and technological advances, diabetes poses an even
bigger problem today than it did in 1816.21
In the 1800s, type 1 diabetes predominated. While almost uniformly
fatal, it was relatively rare. Fast-forward to 2016, when type 1 diabetes
accounts for less than 10 percent of total cases. Type 2 diabetes
dominates and its incidence is growing despite its already endemic
nature. Almost all type 2 diabetes patients are overweight or obese and
will suffer complications related to their diabetes. Although insulin and
other modern medicines can treat blood glucose efficiently, lowering
blood glucose alone does not prevent the complications of diabetes,
including heart disease, stroke, and cancer—leading causes of death.
That we should have a worldwide epidemic of one of the world’s
oldest diseases is a bombshell. Whereas all other diseases, from
smallpox to influenza to tuberculosis to AIDS, have been controlled over
time, the diseases associated with diabetes are increasing at an alarming
rate.
But the question still remains: Why? Why are we powerless to stop
the spread of type 2 diabetes? Why are we powerless to stop the spread
among our children? Why are we powerless to stop the ravages of type 2
diabetes on our bodies? Why are we powerless to prevent the heart
attacks, strokes, blindness, kidney disease, and amputations that
accompany it? More than 3000 years after its discovery, why is there no
cure?
The answer is that we have fundamentally misunderstood the disease
called type 2 diabetes. To design rational treatments that have a chance
of success, we must begin again. We must understand the root causes of
the disease, or in medical terms, the aetiology. What is the aetiology of
type 2 diabetes? Once we understand that, we can begin. Let us begin.
THE DIFERENCES
BETWEEN TYPE 1 AND
TYPE 2 DIABETES
DIABETES MELLITUS COMPRISES a group of metabolic disorders characterized
by chronically elevated blood glucose, or hyperglycemia. The prefix hyper
means “excessive,” and the suffix emia means “in the blood,” so this term
literally means “excessive glucose in the blood.”
There are four broad categories of diabetes mellitus: type 1, type 2,
gestational diabetes (high blood glucose associated with pregnancy), and
other specific types.1 Type 2 diabetes is by far the most common, making
up an estimated 90 percent of cases. Gestational diabetes, by definition,
is not a chronic disease, though it increases the future risk of developing
type 2 diabetes. If hyperglycemia persists after pregnancy, it must be
reclassified as type 1, type 2, or another specific type. Other specific
types of diabetes, listed in Table 2.1, are rare. We will not discuss these
types of diabetes or gestational diabetes any further in this book.

- Infections

DIABETES SYMPTOMS
HYPERGLYCEMIA, OR HIGH blood glucose, characterizes all forms of diabetes.
When blood glucose levels rise above the kidney’s ability to reabsorb the
glucose (the renal threshold), it spills over into the urine, causing
frequent, excessive urination and severe thirst. The chronic loss of
glucose may lead to rapid weight loss and also stimulate the appetite.
The most typical symptoms seen in diabetes therefore include
• increased thirst,
• frequent urination,
• rapid, unexplained weight loss,
• increased hunger despite weight loss, and
• fatigue.
These symptoms of hyperglycemia are common to all forms of
diabetes, but they occur more frequently in type 1 diabetes, since the
onset of type 2 diabetes is typically very gradual. Today, type 2 diabetes
is most often diagnosed during routine blood testing, before patients have
symptoms.
In severe cases, patients—typically those with type 1 diabetes—may
present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Dangerously high levels of acid build
up in the blood due to the severe lack of insulin. Symptoms include
confusion, rapid breathing, abdominal pain, a fruity smell to one’s breath,
and loss of consciousness. This is a true emergency situation, which
needs immediate treatment with insulin.
Severe cases of type 2 diabetes may present with hyperosmolar non-
ketotic syndrome. High blood glucose stimulates excessive urination,
leading to severe dehydration, seizures, coma, and even death. Since
insulin levels are normal or high in type 2 diabetes, ketoacidosis does not
develop.
DIAGNOSING DIABETES
DIABETES MAY BE diagnosed by one of two blood tests: the hemoglobin A1C
(often abbreviated to A1C) or the blood glucose. The A1C, which has
been accepted as a diagnostic criterion by the American Diabetes
Association since 2009, is the most convenient screening test for
diabetes because it does not require fasting and can therefore be done at
any time of the day.
Hemoglobin A1C
HEMOGLOBIN IS A protein found inside red blood cells that carries oxygen to
the entire body. Over the average three-month lifespan of a red blood
cell, glucose molecules attach to the hemoglobin in proportion to the
prevailing blood glucose levels. The amount of glucose attached to the
hemoglobin can be measured with a simple blood test called the
hemoglobin A1C. The A1C thus reflects the body’s average level of blood
glucose over three months.
In North America, the A1C is given as a percentage, while in the U.K.
and Australia, the units are expressed as mmol/mol. The American
Diabetes Association defines an A1C level of 5.7 percent or less to be
normal. A level above 6.5 percent is considered diabetic (see Table 2.2).
Table 2.2. Classification of diabetes and prediabetes according to A1C blood glucose levels
A1C

< 5.7%

Diabetes
Prediabetes is the in-between stage, where blood glucose levels are
abnormally high, but not quite high enough to be considered diabetic. It
denotes a state of very high risk of future progression to full-fledged type
2 diabetes. A patient with a baseline A1C of 6.0–6.5 percent (42– 48
mmol/mol) has an estimated 25–50 percent risk of developing diabetes
within five years. That’s more than twenty times the risk of a person with
an A1C of 5.0 percent (31 mmol/mol).2
Blood glucose
THE SECOND TEST to diagnose diabetes is the blood glucose test, which is
also known as the blood sugar or plasma glucose test. It is measured
using either a fasting blood sugar test or an oral glucose tolerance test
(OGT).
For the fasting blood glucose test, a patient is asked to have no
caloric intake for at least eight hours. A blood sample is then taken and
the amount of glucose in the blood is measured. A level above 7.0
mmol/L (or 126 mg/dL) is considered diabetic.
For the OGT, a patient is asked to ingest a standard test dose of 75
grams of glucose. A blood sample is taken two hours later and the
amount of glucose in the blood is measured. A level above 11.1 mmol/L
(or 200 mg/dL) is considered diabetic.
The A1C has largely replaced the fasting blood glucose test and the
OGT for diagnosis because of its simplicity and convenience, but all of
these tests are considered accurate and acceptable. Occasionally,
diabetes is diagnosed using a random blood sugar test. A blood sample
is taken at a random time and the level of glucose in the blood is
measured. A level above 11.1 mmol/L (or 200 mg/dL) is considered
diabetic if accompanied by other symptoms.
Table 2.3 Diagnostic criteria for diabetes
Fasting blood glucose > 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)
2 hour blood glucose > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) during OGT
A1C > 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
Symptoms of hyperglycemia and random blood glucose >
11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)
The total amount of glucose circulating in the blood at any time is
surprisingly small—roughly a single teaspoonful. Glucose does not float
freely around in the blood. Rather, most of the body’s glucose is
contained within our cells.
Hormones tightly regulate our blood glucose to avoid excessively low
or high levels. Even when we eat large amounts of sugar, the blood
glucose level still remains within a remarkably narrow, controlled range
due to the coordinated actions of various hormones. As glucose is
absorbed through the intestines into the blood, the islet cells within the
pancreas secrete the hormone insulin. Insulin allows the glucose to enter
the cells as fuel for energy. The body stores any excess glucose in the
liver for future use, which keeps our blood glucose from rising out of its
normal range.
TYPE 1 DIABETES: THE FACTS
TYPE 1 DIABETES has been previously called juvenile diabetes, since its
onset commonly occurs during childhood. However, although three-
quarters of all cases are diagnosed in patients under eighteen, it may
present at any age. The global incidence of type 1 diabetes has been
rising in recent decades for unknown reasons and may be increasing by
as much as 5.3 percent annually in the United States.3 In Europe, at
present rates, new cases of type 1 diabetes will double between 2005
and 2030.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, meaning that the body’s
own immune system damages the cells that secrete insulin. The patient’s
blood contains antibodies to normal human islet cells, which provides
evidence of an autoimmune attack. Over time, cumulative destruction of
the insulin-producing cells causes type 1 diabetes to progress to severe
insulin deficiency, whereupon symptoms typically occur.4
There is a strong genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes, but what
eventually triggers the autoimmune destruction is uncertain. Seasonal
variation in diagnosis may point to an infectious trigger, but which specific
one is unclear. Other environmental agents that may play a role include
sensitivity to cow’s milk, wheat protein, and low vitamin D. Type 1
diabetes often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases, such as
Graves’ disease (which affects the thyroid) or vitiligo (which affects the
skin).
Type 1 diabetics suffer from a severe lack of insulin. Therefore the
cornerstone of successful treatment is adequate replacement of the
missing hormone insulin. The discovery of insulin injections dramatically
improved the prognosis, leading to a widespread feeling that diabetes
had been cured. However, the story did not end happily ever after. Over
the long term, type 1 diabetics are at much higher risk of complications,
which affect almost all organs of the body, than nondiabetics. Type 1
diabetes reduces life expectancy by five to eight years and carries more
than ten times the risk of heart disease compared with healthy patients.5
TYPE 2 DIABETES: THE FACTS
TYPE 2 DIABETES has historically afflicted older adults, but the prevalence is
rising quickly in children worldwide,6 mirroring the increase in childhood
obesity.7 One clinic in New York City reported a tenfold increase in new
cases of diabetes from 1990 to 2000, with half of all new cases being
type 2.8 In 2001, less than 3 percent of newly diagnosed diabetes in
adolescents was type 2. Only a decade later, by 2011, this had increased
to 45 percent.9 That is a truly stunning epidemic. In less time than it takes
to age a good cheese, type 2 diabetes had risen like a cyclone, leaving
only devastation in its wake.
Overall, type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 90–95 percent of
diabetes cases worldwide. It typically develops gradually over many
years and progresses in an orderly manner from normal to prediabetes to
full-blown type 2 diabetes. The risk increases with age and obesity.
Hyperglycemia occurs due to insulin resistance, rather than the lack
of insulin, as in type 1 diabetes. When researchers first developed insulin
assays, they expected type 2 diabetes patients to show very low levels,
but to their surprise, insulin levels were high, not low.
The failure of insulin to lower blood glucose is called insulin
resistance. The body overcomes this resistance by increasing insulin
secretion to maintain normal blood glucose levels. The price to be paid is
high insulin levels. However, this compensation has a limit. When insulin
secretion fails to keep pace with increasing resistance, blood glucose
rises, leading to a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
DIFFERENT CAUSES REQUIRE DIFFERENT CURES
FUNDAMENTALLY, TYPE 1 and type 2 diabetes are polar opposites, one
characterized by very low insulin levels and the other by very high ones.
Yet, curiously, standard drug treatment paradigms for the two types are
identical. Both primarily target blood glucose, with the goal of lowering it
by increasing insulin, even though the high level of blood glucose is only
the symptom of the disease and not the disease itself. Insulin helps type
1 diabetes because that disease’s underlying core problem is a lack of
naturally occurring insulin in the body. However, the underlying core
problem of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance and it remains virtually
untreated because there is no clear consensus upon its cause. Without
this understanding, we don’t have a hope of reversing it. That is our
challenge. It may appear formidable, but its rewards are equally enticing:
a cure for type 2 diabetes.
THE WHOLE
BODY EFFECT
DIABETES, UNLIKE VIRTUALLY every other known disease, has the unique and
malignant potential to devastate our entire body. Practically no organ
system remains unaffected by diabetes. These complications are
generally classified as either microvascular (small blood vessels) or
macrovascular (large blood vessels).
Certain organs, such as the eyes, kidneys, and nerves, are mostly
supplied by small blood vessels. Damage to these small blood vessels
results in the visual problems, chronic kidney disease, and nerve damage
typically seen in patients with long-standing diabetes. Collectively, these
are called microvascular diseases.
Other organs, such as the heart, brain, and legs, are perfused by
large blood vessels. Damage to larger blood vessels results in narrowing
called atherosclerotic plaque. When this plaque ruptures, it triggers the
inflammation and blood clots that cause heart attacks, strokes, and
gangrene of the legs. Together, these are known as macrovascular
diseases.
How diabetes causes this damage to blood vessels will be discussed
throughout this book. It was widely considered to be simply a
consequence of high blood glucose, but the truth, as we’ll see, is far
different. Beyond the vascular diseases are many other complications,
including skin conditions, fatty liver disease, infections, polycystic ovarian
syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. However, let’s begin with the
problems associated with small blood vessels.
MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS
Retinopathy
DIABETES IS THE leading cause of blindness in the United States.1 Eye
disease—characteristically retinal damage (retinopathy)—is one of the
most frequent complications of diabetes. The retina is the light-sensitive
nerve layer at the back of the eye that sends its “picture” to the brain.
Diabetes weakens the small, retinal blood vessels, which causes blood
and other fluids to leak out. During routine physical eye examinations,
this leakage can be visualized with a standard ophthalmoscope.
In response to this damage, new retinal blood vessels form, but they
are fragile and easily broken. The result is more bleeding and the
eventual formation of scar tissue. In severe cases, this scar tissue can lift
the retina and pull it away from its normal position, ultimately leading to
blindness. Laser treatment can prevent retinopathy by sealing or
destroying the leaky new blood vessels.
Approximately 10,000 new cases of blindness in the United States are
caused by diabetic retinopathy each year.2 Whether retinopathy develops
depends on how long a person has had diabetes as well as how severe
the disease is.3 In type 1 diabetes, most patients develop some degree of
retinopathy within twenty years. In type 2 diabetes, retinopathy may
actually develop up to seven years before the diabetes itself is
diagnosed.
Nephropathy
THE MAIN JOB of the kidneys is to clean the blood. When they fail, toxins
build up in the body, which leads to loss of appetite, weight loss, and
persistent nausea and vomiting. If the disease goes untreated, it
eventually leads to coma and death. In the United States, more than
100,000 patients are diagnosed with chronic kidney disease annually,
costing $32 billion in 2005. The burden is not only financially enormous,
but emotionally devastating.
Diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) is the leading cause of end
stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, accounting for 44
percent of all new cases in 2005.4 Patients whose kidneys have lost over
90 percent of their intrinsic function require dialysis to artificially remove
the accumulated toxins in the blood. This procedure involves removing
the patient’s “dirty” blood, running it through the dialysis machine to clean
out its impurities, and then returning the clean blood to the body. To stay
alive, patients require four hours of dialysis, three times per week,
indefinitely, unless they receive a transplant.
Figure 3.1. Adjusted prevalence rates of end stage renal disease5
Diabetic kidney disease often takes fifteen to twenty-five years to
develop, but, like retinopathy, it may occasionally be diagnosed before
type 2 diabetes, itself. Approximately 2 percent of type 2 diabetic patients
develop kidney disease each year. Ten years after diagnosis, 25 percent
of patients will have evidence of kidney disease.6 Once established,
diabetic nephropathy tends to progress, leading to more and more kidney
impairment until eventually the patient requires dialysis or transplantation.
Neuropathy
DIABETIC NERVE DAMAGE (neuropathy) affects approximately 60–70 percent
of patients with diabetes.7 Once again, the longer the duration and
severity of diabetes, the greater the risk of neuropathy.8
There are many different types of diabetic nerve damage. Commonly,
diabetic neuropathy affects the peripheral nerves, first in the feet, and
then progressively in the hands and arms as well, in a characteristic
stocking-and-glove distribution. Damage to different types of nerves will
result in different symptoms, including
•
tingling,
•
numbness,
•
burning, and
•
pain.
The incessant pain of severe diabetic neuropathy is debilitating, and
the symptoms are commonly worse at night. Even powerful painkillers
such as narcotic medications are often ineffective. Instead of pain,
patients may sometimes experience complete numbness. Careful
physical examination reveals decreased sensations of touch, vibration,
and temperature, and a loss of reflexes in the affected parts of the body.
While a loss of sensation may seem innocuous, it is anything but.
Pain protects us against damaging trauma. When we stub our toes, or lie
in the wrong position, pain lets us know that we should quickly adjust
ourselves in order to prevent further tissue damage. If we are unable to
feel pain, we may continue to experience repeated episodes of trauma.
Over years, the damage becomes progressive and sometimes
deformative. A typical example is the foot. Significant nerve damage can
lead to the complete destruction of the joint—a condition called Charcot
foot—and may progress to the point where patients are unable to walk,
and may even require amputation.
Another nerve disorder affecting the large muscle groups is called
diabetic amyotrophy, which is characterized by severe pain and muscle
weakness, particularly in the thighs.9
The autonomic nervous system controls our automatic body functions,
such as breathing, digestion, sweating, and heart rate. Damage to these
nerves may cause nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, bladder
dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and orthostatic hypotension (a sudden,
severe drop of blood pressure on standing up). If the nerves to the heart
are affected, the risk of silent heart attacks and death increases.10
No current treatment reverses diabetic nerve damage. Drugs may
help the symptoms of the disease but do not change its natural history.
Ultimately, it can only be prevented.
MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS
Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)
ATHEROSCLEROSIS IS A disease of the arteries whereby plaques of fatty
material are deposited within the inner walls of the blood vessel, causing
narrowing and hardening. This condition causes heart attacks, strokes,
and peripheral vascular disease, which are collectively known as
cardiovascular diseases. Diabetes greatly increases the risk of
developing atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is popularly but incorrectly imagined as cholesterol
slowly clogging the arteries, much as sludge might build up in a pipe. In
actuality, it results from injury to the artery, although the exact cause of
the injury is unknown. There are many contributing factors, including but
not limited to age, genetics, smoking, diabetes, stress, high blood
pressure, and lack of physical activity. Any breach of the artery’s walls
can initiate an inflammatory cascade. Cholesterol (a waxy, fat-like
substance found in all cells of the body) infiltrates the damaged area and
narrows the blood vessel. The smooth muscle that supports the tissue of
the blood vessel proliferates, and collagen, a structural protein found
abundantly in the body, also accumulates in response to this injury.
Again, the result is a further narrowing of the blood vessel. Rather than a
single episode that can be simply repaired, this response occurs in
reaction to chronic injuries to the vessel wall.
The end result is the development of plaque, known as the atheroma,
which is a pocket of cholesterol, smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory
cells inside the blood vessel wall. This progressively limits the flow of
blood to affected organs. If this atheroma ruptures, a blood clot forms.
The sudden blockage of the artery by the clot prevents normal blood
circulation and starves the downstream cells of oxygen, causing cell
death and cardiovascular disease.
Heart disease
HEART ATTACKS, KNOWN medically as myocardial infarctions, are the most
well-recognized and feared complication of diabetes. They are caused by
atherosclerosis of the blood vessels supplying the heart. The sudden
blockage of these arteries starves the heart of oxygen, resulting in the
death of part of the heart muscle.
The Framingham studies of the 1970s established a strong
association between heart disease and diabetes.11 Diabetes increases
the risk of cardiovascular disease two- to fourfold, and these
complications develop at a younger age compared to nondiabetics. Sixty-
eight percent of diabetics aged sixty-five or older will die of heart disease,
and a further 16 percent will die of stroke.12 Reducing the risk of
macrovascular disease is therefore of primary importance. The extent of
death and disability resulting from cardiovascular diseases is many times
greater than that resulting from microvascular diseases.
Over the past three decades, there have been significant
improvements in the treatment of heart disease, but gains for diabetic
patients have lagged far behind. While the overall death rate for
nondiabetic men has decreased by 36.4 percent, it has only decreased
13.1 percent for diabetic men.13
Stroke
A STROKE IS caused by atherosclerosis of the large blood vessels
supplying the brain. A sudden disruption of the normal blood flow starves
the brain of oxygen and a portion of the brain may die. Symptoms vary
depending upon which part of the brain is affected, but the devastating
impact of stroke cannot be underestimated. In the United States, it is the
third leading cause of death and the biggest contributor to disability.
Diabetes is a strong independent risk factor in stroke, meaning that,
on its own, diabetes increases a person’s risk of having a stroke by as
much as 150–400 percent.14 Approximately a quarter of all new strokes
occur in diabetic patients.15 Every year of diabetes increases the risk of
stroke by 3 percent,16 and the prognosis is also far worse.
Peripheral vascular disease
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) is caused by atherosclerosis of the
large blood vessels supplying the legs. The disruption of normal blood
flow starves the legs of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin. The most common
symptom of PVD is pain or cramping that appears with walking and is
relieved by rest. As the blood vessels narrow and circulation worsens,
pain may also appear at rest and especially at night. PVD significantly
reduces mobility, which can lead to long-term disability.
Skin with a poor blood supply is more likely to be damaged and takes
longer to heal. In diabetics, minor cuts or injuries to the feet may become
non-healing foot ulcers. In severe cases, these areas where the skin has
broken down, revealing underlying tissue, can progress to gangrene. At
this point, blood supply has been greatly reduced or completely lost, the
tissue dies, and amputation of the affected limb—a treatment of last
resort—often becomes necessary to treat chronic infections and relieve
pain.
Diabetes, along with smoking, is the strongest risk factor for PVD.
Approximately 27 percent of diabetic patients with PVD will progressively
worsen over a five-year period, and 4 percent of them will need an
amputation.17 Patients with gangrene and those requiring amputation
may never walk again, which can result in a cycle of disability. A loss of
function of the limbs leads to less physical activity, which in turn leads to
progressive deconditioning of the muscles. Weaker muscles lead to less
physical activity, and the cycle repeats.
OTHER COMPLICATIONS
Alzheimer’s disease
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE IS a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative disease
that causes memory loss, personality changes, and cognitive problems. It
is the most common form of dementia, and the sixth leading cause of
death in the United States.18 Alzheimer’s disease may reflect the inability
to use glucose normally, perhaps a type of selective insulin resistance in
the brain. The links between Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes have
grown so strong that many researchers have suggested Alzheimer’s
disease can be called type 3 diabetes.19 These arguments go far beyond
the scope of this book, however.
Cancer
TYPE 2 DIABETES increases the risk of most common cancers, including
breast, stomach, colorectal, kidney, and endometrial cancers. This may
be related to some of the medications used to treat diabetes and will be
further discussed in chapter 10. The survival rate of cancer patients with
pre-existing diabetes is far worse than for nondiabetics.20
Fatty liver disease
NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as the storage and
accumulation of excess fat in the form of triglycerides exceeding 5
percent of the total weight of the liver. This condition can be detected
using an ultrasound to examine the abdomen. When this excess fat
causes damage to the liver tissue, which can be revealed through
standard blood tests, it is called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Current estimates suggest that NAFLD affects 30 percent and NASH 5
percent of the U.S. population; both are important causes of liver
cirrhosis (irreversible scarring of the liver).21
NAFLD is virtually non-existent in recent-onset type 1 diabetes. By
contrast, the incidence in type 2 diabetes is estimated at upwards of 75
percent. The central role of fatty liver is more fully explained in chapter 7.
Infections
DIABETICS ARE MORE prone to all types of infections, which are caused by
foreign organisms invading and multiplying in the body. Not only are they
more susceptible to many types of bacterial and fungal infections than
nondiabetics, the effects also tend to be more serious. For example,
diabetics have a four- to fivefold higher risk of developing a serious
kidney infection.22 All types of fungal infections, including thrush, vaginal
yeast infections, fungal infections of the nails, and athlete’s foot, are more
common in diabetic patients.
Among the most serious infections for diabetics are those involving
the feet. Despite adequate blood glucose control, 15 percent of all
diabetic patients will develop non-healing foot wounds during their
lifetime. Infections in these wounds often involve multiple
microorganisms, making broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment necessary.
However, the decreased blood circulation associated with PVD (see
above) contributes to the poor wound healing. As a result, diabetics have
a fifteen-fold increased risk of lower-limb amputation, and account for
over 50 percent of the amputations done in the United States, excluding
accidents. It is estimated that each of these cases of infected diabetic
foot ulcers costs upwards of $25,000 to treat.23
There are many contributing factors to the higher rates of infection.
High blood glucose may impair the immune system. As well, poor blood
circulation decreases the ability of infection-fighting white blood cells to
reach all parts of the body.
Skin and nail conditions
NUMEROUS SKIN AND nail conditions are linked to diabetes. Generally, they
are more of an aesthetic concern than a medical one; however, they
often indicate the underlying serious condition of diabetes, which requires
medical management.
Acanthosis nigricans is a gray-black, velvety thickening of the skin,
particularly around the neck and in body folds, caused by high insulin
levels. Diabetic dermopathy, also called shin spots, are often found on
the lower extremities as dark, finely scaled lesions. Skin tags are soft
protrusions of skin often found on the eyelids, neck, and armpits. Over 25
percent of patients with skin tags have diabetes.24
Nail problems are also common in diabetic patients, particularly fungal
infections. The nails may become yellowy-brown, thicken, and separate
from the nail bed (onycholysis).
Erectile dysfunction
COMUNITY-BASED POPULATION studies of males aged 39–70 years found that
the prevalence of impotence ranges between 10 and 50 percent.
Diabetes is a key risk factor, increasing the risk of erectile dysfunction
more than threefold and afflicting patients at a younger age than usual.
Poor blood circulation in diabetics is the likely reason for this increased
risk. The risk of erectile dysfunction also increases with age and severity
of insulin resistance, with an estimated 50–60 percent of diabetic men
above the age of 50 having this problem.25
Polycystic ovarian syndrome
AN IMBALANCE OF the hormones can cause some women to develop cysts
(benign masses) on the ovaries. This condition, called polycystic ovarian
syndrome (PCOS), is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, evidence
of excessive testosterone, and the presence of cysts (usually detected by
ultrasound). PCOS patients share many of the same characteristics as
type 2 diabetics, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
and insulin resistance. PCOS is caused by elevated insulin resistance26
and increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes three-to fivefold in
young women.
TREAT THE CAUSE, NOT THE SYMPTOMS
WHEREAS MOST DISEASES are limited to a single organ system, diabetes
affects every organ in multiple ways. As a result, it is the leading cause of
blindness. It is the leading cause of kidney failure. It is the leading cause
of heart disease. It is the leading cause of stroke. It is the leading cause
of amputations. It is the leading cause of dementia. It is the leading cause
of infertility. It is the leading cause of nerve damage.
But the perplexing question is why these problems are getting worse,
not better, even centuries after the disease was first described. As our
understanding of diabetes increases, we expect that complications
should decrease. But they don’t. If the situation is getting worse, then the
only logical explanation is that our understanding and treatment of type 2
diabetes is fundamentally flawed.
We focus obsessively on lowering blood glucose. But high blood
glucose is only the symptom, not the cause. The root cause of the
hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes is high insulin resistance. Until we
address that root cause, insulin resistance, the epidemic of type 2
diabetes and all of its associated complications will continue to get worse.
We need to start again. What causes type 2 diabetes? What causes
insulin resistance and how can we reverse it? Obviously, obesity plays a
large role. We must begin with the aetiology of obesity.
SIMON
When he came to the Intensive Dietary Management (IDM)
program, Simon, 66, weighed 267 pounds, with a waist
circumference of 135 cm and a BMI of 43. He had been
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes eight years earlier and was
taking the medications sitagliptin, metformin, and glicizide to
control his blood glucose. In addition, he had a history of high
blood pressure and part of one kidney had been removed
because of cancer.
We counseled him on a low-carbohydrate, healthy-fat diet
and suggested that he start fasting for 24 hours, three times
per week. Within six months, he was down to a single
medication, canagliflozin, which he continued taking for a
period of time to help with weight loss. After another year, we
discontinued this medication as Simon’s weight and blood
glucose had significantly improved. He has not needed any
medications since.
At his last checkup, Simon’s hemoglobin A1C was 5.9%,
which is considered nondiabetic, and he had maintained a 45-
pound weight loss for two years and counting. Today, he is
ecstatic about the change in his overall health. He has gone
from wearing a size 46 pant to a 40, and the type 2 diabetes,
which he believed was a lifelong disease, has completely
reversed. Simon continues to follow a low-carbohydrate diet
and fasts once or twice per week for 24 hours.
BRIDGET
When we first met Bridget, 62, she had a ten-year history of
type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and high blood
pressure. She was severely insulin resistant, requiring a total of
210 units of insulin every day to keep her blood glucose under
control. She weighed 325 pounds, with a waist size of 147 cm
and a BMI of 54.1.
Determined to get off insulin, she started with a seven-day
fast but felt so well and so empowered that she continued for
another two weeks. By the end of the 21 days, she had not
only stopped all her insulin but required no diabetic
medications at all. To maintain her weight loss, she switched
from fasting continuously to fasting for 24 to 36 hours every
other day, and she resumed taking dapagliflozin to help control
her weight. During this time her A1C was 6.8%, which was
actually better than when she was taking insulin.
Before starting the IDM program, Bridget had very low
energy levels and could barely make it into my office on her
own two legs. Once she started to fast, her energy levels
improved significantly and she was easily able to walk around.
Her dress size dropped from size 30 to 22. Bridget has been
off insulin for three years now and has maintained a total
weight loss of 63 pounds over that time. Her blood pressure
has normalized and she has stopped taking medication.
DIABESITY: THE CALORIE DECEPTION
DIABESITY IS THE unification of the words diabetes, referring to type 2, and
obesity. Just like the evocative “bromance,” it conveys the close
relationship between these two ideas. Diabetes and obesity are truly one
and the same disease. As strange as it may now sound, physicians did
not always recognize this seemingly obvious and basic connection.
Back in 1990, when grunge was taking over the music scene and
fanny packs were growing in popularity beyond the middle-aged dad
tourist, Dr. Walter Willett, now Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at
Harvard’s School of Public Health, identified the strong and consistent
relationship between weight gain and type 2 diabetes.
The obesity epidemic had only just gotten underway in the late 1970s
and was not yet the public health disaster it is today. Type 2 diabetes
barely scratched the surface as a public health concern. Instead, AIDS
was the hot topic of the day. And type 2 diabetes and obesity were not
thought to be related in any way. Indeed, the Report of the Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee issued by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in 1990 allowed that some weight gain after the age of thirty-
five was consistent with good health.
That same year, Dr. Willett challenged the conventional thinking,
reporting that weight gain after age eighteen was the major determinant
of type 2 diabetes.1 A weight gain of 20–35 kg (44–77 pounds) increased
the risk of type 2 diabetes by 11,300 percent. Gaining more than 35 kg
(77 pounds) increased the risk by 17,300 percent! Even smaller amounts
of weight gain could raise the risk significantly. But this idea was not an
easy sell to a sceptical medical profession.2 “We had a hard time getting
the first paper published showing that even slight overweight greatly
increased the risk of diabetes,” Willett remembers. “They didn’t believe
it.”
BODY MASS INDEX: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OBESITY AND DIABETES
THE BODY MAS index is a standardized measurement of weight, and it is
calculated by the following formula:
Body mass index = Weight (kg)/Height2 (m2)
A body mass index of 25.0 or higher is considered overweight, while a
body mass index of between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range.
Table 4.1. Body mass index classifications
Body Mass Index
Classification
< 18.5
Underweight
18.5–24.9
Normal weight
25.0–29.9
Overweight
30.0–34.9
Obese
35.0–39.9
Severe Obesity
> 40.0
Morbid Obesity
However, women with a body mass index of 23–23.9 have a 360-
percent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than women with a
body mass index of less than 22, which is even more stunning since a
body mass index of 23.9 is considered well within the normal weight
range.
By 1995, building on this new realization, researchers had determined
that a weight gain of only 5.0–7.9 kg (11–17.5 pounds) increased the risk
of type 2 diabetes by 90 percent, and a weight gain of 8.0–10.9 kg (17.5–
24 pounds) increased the risk by 270 percent.3 By contrast, weight loss
decreased risk by more than 50 percent. This result established an
intimate relationship between weight gain and type 2 diabetes. But far
more sinister, this excess weight also significantly increased the risk of
death.4
More supporting evidence would soon surface. Dr. Frank Speizer from
the Harvard School of Public Health had established the original Nurses’
Health Study (NHS) in 1976. One of the largest investigations into risk
factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, this long-term
epidemiological study included 121,700 female nurses from around the
Boston area.
Dr. Willett continued with the Nurses’ Health Study II, which collected
data every two years on an additional 116,000 female nurses since 1989.
At the start of the study, all the participants were relatively healthy, but
over time, many of them developed chronic diseases such as diabetes
and heart disease. By looking back at the collected data, some idea of
the risk factors for these diseases emerged. In 2001, Dr. Willett5 showed
that, once again, the single most important risk factor for the
development of type 2 diabetes was obesity.
GLYCEMIC INDEX: DIET AND DIABETES
THE NURSES’ HEALTH Study II revealed that other lifestyle variables were
also important. Maintaining a normal weight, getting regular physical
exercise, not smoking, and eating a healthy diet could prevent a stunning
91 percent of type 2 diabetes. But the million-dollar question is: What is a
“healthy” diet? Dr. Willett’s healthy diet was defined as high in cereal
fiber, high in polyunsaturated fats, low in trans fat, and low in glycemic
load.
When digested, carbohydrates break down into glucose. The
glycemic index measures the rise in blood glucose after ingesting 50
grams of carbohydrate-containing foods. However, the amount of
carbohydrates contained in a standard serving varies enormously. For
example, a standard serving of fruit may contain less than 50 grams of
carbohydrates whereas a single pastry may contain far more. The
glycemic load refines this measure by multiplying the glycemic index of a
food by the grams of carbohydrate in a standard serving of that food.
Generally, foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates are high in
glycemic load. Dietary fats and proteins, since they raise blood glucose
very little, have minimal glycemic loads. Contrary to the low-fat diet
recommended by all the medical associations around the world, Dr.
Willett’s healthy diet was high in dietary fat and protein. His diet was
about reducing sugar and refined carbohydrates, not reducing dietary fat.
In 1990, the widespread belief was that dietary fat was evil, that
dietary fat was a mass murderer, that dietary fat was vile. The term
healthy fats did not exist. It was an oxymoron, like a jumbo shrimp. Fat-
laden avocados? A heart attack in a fruit. Fat-laden nuts? A heart attack
in a snack. Olive oil? Liquid heart attacks. Most people fervently believed
fats were going to clog our arteries, but it was only an illusion.
Dr. Zoë Harcombe, a Cambridge University–trained obesity
researcher, reviewed all the data that had been available in the early
1980s, when low-fat guidelines were introduced in the U.S. and U.K. No
proof had ever existed that natural dietary fats worsened cardiovascular
disease. The evidence for the low-fat guidelines was simply a great work
of fiction.6 The science was far from settled at the time the government
decided to weigh in and make the final decision to vilify dietary fat. Yet
this belief had become so entrenched both in the medical establishment
and among the general public that it had become heretical to suggest
refined grains and sugars were the problem rather than dietary fat.
In the midst of our frenzied low-fat obsession, Dr. Willett’s assertion
was considered high treason. But the truth could not be concealed
forever. Today, we understand clearly that obesity is the main underlying
issue behind type 2 diabetes. But the problem isn’t simply obesity.
Rather, it is abdominal obesity.
WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE: FAT DISTRIBUTION AND TYPE 2 DIABETES
IN 2012, Dr. Michael Mosley was a TOFI. A what? Not tofu, the delicious
Asian soy delicacy. The acronym TOFI stands for “thin on the outside, fat
on the inside.” Dr. Mosley is a medical doctor, British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) journalist, documentary filmmaker, and international
bestselling author. And, in his mid-50s, he was also a ticking time bomb.
He was not particularly overweight, weighing 187 pounds, standing 5
feet 11 inches, with a waist of 36 inches. This equals a body mass index
of 26.1, just barely in the overweight range. By standard measurements,
he was considered just fine. He felt fine, perhaps carrying a little bit of
weight around the mid-section from being middle-aged. Just a little
pudge, that’s all.
However, body mass index is not the best indicator of type 2 diabetes
risk. The waist circumference, a measure of body fat distribution around
the trunk, is a far superior predictor of type 2 diabetes.7 Filming a health
segment for the BBC, Mosley underwent a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) body scan. To his shock and consternation, his organs were literally
swimming in fat. To look at him, you would not have guessed it because
most of the fat was hidden inside his abdomen.
Eighteen months later, during a visit to his own physician, routine
screening blood tests revealed type 2 diabetes. Devastated, Dr. Mosley
says, “I had assumed I was healthy and suddenly I was discovering I
wasn’t, and had to take this visceral fat situation seriously.”8 Visceral fat
accumulates inside and around the intra-abdominal organs such as the
liver, kidneys, and intestines, and can be detected by an increased waist
circumference. This pattern of obesity, where most of the fat is carried
around the abdomen, is also known as central obesity, or central
adiposity. In contrast, subcutaneous fat is the fat deposited directly under
the skin.
The different health risks associated with the different fat distributions
explain how roughly 30 percent of obese adults are metabolically
normal.9 These healthy-fat people carry more subcutaneous fat rather
than the more dangerous visceral fat. On the other hand, some normal-
weight people show the same metabolic abnormalities as in obesity10
because of excessive visceral fat.
Type 2 diabetes may be diagnosed for patients with a wide range of
body mass indexes, following a normal distribution with no distinct
subpopulation of “thin” diabetics.11 A full 36 percent of newly diagnosed
diabetics have a normal body mass index of less than 25. Look at Figure
4.1. The key clinical indicator is clearly not total body fat as measured by
body mass index. Rather, it’s visceral or intra-organic fat.12
Figure 4.1. Population BMI distribution for newly diagnosed diabetes13
Independent of total weight, central obesity is highly correlated to
metabolic abnormalities,14 increased cardiac risk,15 and progression to
type 2 diabetes.16 Reducing visceral fat also successfully reduces the
risk of progression of type 2 diabetes.17
Subcutaneous fat, on the other hand, shows little correlation to type 2
diabetes or heart disease. The surgical removal, via liposuction,18 of
almost 10 kilograms of subcutaneous fat brought no significant metabolic
benefits whatsoever, which suggests that subcutaneous fat plays little
role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
The waist-to-height ratio is a simple measure of central adiposity,
calculated by comparing waist circumference to height. This ratio is far
more predictive of years of life lost than body mass index.19 Optimally,
your waist circumference should be less than half your height. For
example, an average man standing 5 foot 10 inches (70 inches) should
strive to maintain a waist size of 35 inches or less. As central obesity
increases, risk of metabolic disease skyrockets.
Figure 4.2. Waist-to-height ratio and years of life lost (YLL): A dramatic increase20
There is a distinction even between types of visceral fat. Fat found
inside the organs, such as within the liver and pancreas, is called intra-
organic fat and is distinctly more dangerous than fat found around the
organs, called omental fat. Intra-organic fat increases the risk for the
metabolic complications of obesity, including type 2 diabetes, NASH (non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis, or fatty liver disease), and cardiovascular
disease.21 On the other hand, surgical removal of omental fat does not
result in any metabolic improvement.22
Fat within the liver, called intrahepatic fat, plays a crucial role in the
development of insulin resistance.23 Central obesity tracks very closely
with intrahepatic fat content.24 Fat within the pancreas also plays a
leading role in type 2 diabetes, as we will see in chapter 7.
So, given the principal role of central obesity, what drives this fat
deposition into the organs? Isn’t it all about calories?
CALORIE CONFUSION: NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIABETES AND CALORIES
EAT LES. CUT your calories. Watch your portion size. These mantras have
formed the foundation of conventional weight-loss advice over the past
fifty years. And the widespread obesity epidemic proves that this advice
has been an utter disaster, perhaps only topped by the nuclear meltdown
of Chernobyl. This caloric reduction advice is based on a false
understanding of what causes weight gain.
What causes obesity? We don’t stop to consider this basic question
because we believe that we already know the full answer. It seems so
obvious, doesn’t it? Excessive intake of calories causes obesity. Too
many calories in compared to too few calories out leads to weight gain.
This energy balance model of obesity has been drilled into us since
childhood.
Fat Gained = Calories In – Calories Out
For the past fifty years, our best weight-loss advice was primarily to
restrict our caloric intake. Specifically, we were told to restrict the amount
of dietary fat, which is calorically dense. This means reducing foods high
in fat, such as meat, butter, cheese, and nuts, in order to lower our
calorie intake and therefore lose weight. We made food guides, food
pyramids, and food plates to indoctrinate children into this brand-new,
low-calorie religion. “Cut Your Calories,” we declared. “Eat Less, Move
More,” we chanted.
Nutrition labels were mandated to include calorie counts. Programs
and apps were created to more precisely count calories. We invented
small devices such as Fitbits to measure exactly how many calories we
were burning. Using all our ingenuity, focused like a laser beam and
dogged as a turtle crossing a road, we cut calories.
What was the result? Did the problem of obesity simply fade away like
the morning mist on a hot summer day? In a word, no. The underlying,
unspoken premise of this model is that energy creation (calories in),
energy expenditure (calories out), and fat gain are independent variables
fully under our conscious control. It assumes that the number of calories
used to keep our bodies running more or less normally remains stable
and unchanging. But this is untrue.
The truth is that the body can adjust its basal metabolic rate (BMR)—
the energy required to keep the heart pumping, lungs breathing, kidneys
and liver detoxifying, brain thinking, body generating heat, and so on—up
or down by 40 percent. When you eat fewer calories, your body slows
down so it uses fewer calories, which means you don’t lose weight.
This model also completely ignores the multiple overlapping hormonal
systems that signal hunger and satiety. That is, we may decide what to
eat and when to eat it, but we cannot decide to feel less hungry. We
cannot decide when to burn calories as body heat and when to store
them as body fat. Hormones make these decisions. The results of the so-
called “caloric reduction as primary” advice could hardly have been worse
if we had tried. The storm of obesity and type 2 diabetes that began in
the late 1970s has today, some forty years later, become a global
category 5 hurricane threatening to engulf the entire world in sickness
and disability.
Only two possibilities can explain how obesity could spread so rapidly
in the face of our shiny new advice to reduce fat and calories: first,
perhaps this advice is good but people are simply not following it;
second, perhaps the advice is simply wrong.
The idea that the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak—that people
have the dream but not the drive—is as absurd as expecting a drowning
man to laugh.
Was the entire obesity epidemic simply a sudden, simultaneous,
coordinated, worldwide lack of willpower? The world can’t agree which
side of the road we should drive on, yet, without discussion, we all
decided to eat more and move less so that we could become undesirably
fat? This explanation is only the latest iteration of the game called “blame
the victim.” It shifts the responsibility from the advice giver (the advice is
bad) to the advice taker (the advice is good, but you are not following it).
By declaring that their scientifically unproven caloric reduction advice
was flawless, doctors and nutritionists could conveniently shift the blame
from themselves to you. It wasn’t their fault. It was yours. Their advice
was good. You didn’t follow it. No wonder they love this game so much.
To admit that all their precious theories of obesity were simply incorrect
was too psychologically difficult. Yet evidence continued to accumulate
that this new caloric restriction strategy was about as useful as a comb to
a bald man.
The Women’s Health Initiative25 was the most ambitious, important
nutrition study ever done. This randomized trial involving almost 50,000
women evaluated the low-fat, low-calorie approach to weight loss.
Although it was not specifically a weight-loss trial, one group of women
was encouraged through intensive counseling to reduce their daily caloric
intake by 342 calories and to increase their level of exercise by 10
percent. These calorie counters expected a weight loss of 32 pounds
every single year.
When the final results were tallied in 1997, there was only crushing
disappointment. Despite good compliance, more than seven years of
calorie counting had led to virtually no weight loss. Not even a single
pound. This study was a stunning and severe rebuke to the caloric theory
of obesity. Reducing calories did not lead to weight loss.
There were now two choices. First, we could respect the expensive,
hard-won, scientific evidence to devise a robust, more correct theory of
obesity. Or we could simply keep all our comfortable and convenient
preconceived notions and biases and ignore the science. The second
choice involved far less work and far less imagination. So this ground-
breaking study has largely been ignored and relegated to the dustbins of
nutritional history. We have been paying the pied piper every day since,
as the twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes have exploded.
Real-world studies26 have only confirmed this stunning fiasco. The
conventional weight-loss advice to eat fewer calories carries an
estimated failure rate of 99.4 percent. For morbid obesity, the failure rate
is 99.9 percent. These statistics would not surprise anybody in the diet
industry or, for that matter, anybody who has ever tried to lose weight.
The Calories-In, Calories-Out theory gained widespread acceptance
based on its seemingly intuitive truth. However, like a rotting melon,
digging past the outer shell revealed the putrid interior. This simplistic
formula is riddled with erroneous assumptions. The most important error
is believing that basal metabolic rate, or Calories Out, always remains
stable. But a 40-percent reduction in calorie intake is quickly met with a
40-percent decrease in basal metabolic rate. The net result is no weight
loss.
The other major false assumption is that weight is consciously
regulated. But no system in our body functions like that. The thyroid,
parathyroid, sympathetic, parasympathetic, respiratory, circulatory,
hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, and adrenal systems are all closely
controlled by hormones. Body weight and body fat are also strictly
regulated by hormones. In fact, our bodies contain multiple overlapping
systems of body weight control. Body fat, one of the most important
determinants of survival in the wild, is simply not left to the vagaries of
what we decide to put in our mouths.
HORMONES: FOOD, BODY WEIGHT, AND DIABETES
HORMONES CONTROL HUNGER, telling our body when to eat and when to
stop. Ghrelin is a powerful hormone that causes hunger, and
cholecystokinin and peptide YY are hormones that tell us when we are full
and should stop eating. Imagine you’re at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
You’ve already eaten many heaping platefuls of food and you are
completely, 110-percent full.
Now, could you eat a few more pork chops? Merely the thought might
make you nauseous. Yet these are the same pork chops you ate happily
just a few minutes ago. The difference is that satiety hormones are
exerting a powerful effect to stop you from eating. Contrary to many
popular beliefs, we do not continue eating simply because food is
available. Calorie consumption is under tight hormonal regulation.
Fat accumulation is truly not a problem of energy excess. It’s a
problem of energy distribution. Too much energy is diverted to producing
fat as opposed to, say, increasing body heat or forming new bone tissue.
This energy expenditure is controlled hormonally. As long as we believed,
wrongly, that excessive caloric intake led to obesity, we were doomed to
failure as we uselessly tried to reduce calories.
We cannot “decide” to feel less hungry. We cannot “decide” to
increase basal metabolic rate. If we eat fewer calories, our body simply
compensates by decreasing its metabolic rate. If calories are not the
underlying cause of weight gain, then reducing calories cannot reliably
reduce weight. The most important factor in controlling fat accumulation
and weight gain is to control the hormonal signals we receive from food,
not the total number of calories we eat.
Obesity is a hormonal imbalance, not a caloric one. The hormonal
problem in undesired weight gain is mainly excessive insulin. Thus, type
2 diabetes, too, is a disease about insulin imbalance rather than caloric
imbalance.
THE ROLE OF INSULIN IN
ENERGY STORAGE
HERE’S A STARTLING fact: I can make you fat. Actually, I can make anybody
fat. How? It’s really quite simple. I prescribe insulin. Although insulin is a
natural hormone, excessive insulin causes weight gain and obesity.
Hormones are essentially chemical messengers. They are produced
by the endocrine system, a network of glands found throughout the body
to maintain proper function. The pea-sized pituitary gland in the brain is
often called the master gland because it produces many different
hormones that control metabolic processes in other parts of the body. For
example, it secretes growth hormone, which signals the rest of the body,
including the bones and muscles, to grow bigger. The butterfly-shaped
thyroid gland in the neck produces thyroid hormone to deliver its
message to the rest of the body. When it receives this signal, the heart
may beat faster, breathing may accelerate, and the basal metabolic rate
may increase. Similarly, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that
delivers several different messages mostly relating to the intake and
storage of food energy.
INSULIN BASICS
WHEN WE EAT, foods are broken down in the stomach and small intestine
for easier absorption. All foods are composed of three main constituents,
called macronutrients. These are proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, and
they are all handled differently by the digestive system. Proteins are
broken down into amino acids. Fats are broken down into fatty acids.
Carbohydrates, composed of chains of sugars, are broken down into
smaller sugars, including glucose. Micronutrients, as the name implies,
are nutrients that are necessary for good health in far smaller quantities,
such as vitamins and minerals.
One of insulin’s roles is to facilitate the uptake of glucose into cells for
energy, by opening a channel to allow it inside. Hormones find their target
cell by binding to receptors on the cell surface, much like a key fitting into
a lock. Only the correct hormone can open the receptor and deliver the
message. Insulin works like the key, fitting snugly into the lock on the cell
to open a gateway for glucose. Every cell in the body can use glucose for
energy. Without insulin, glucose circulating in the blood cannot easily
enter the cell.
In type 1 diabetes, autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting cells
leads to abnormally low levels of insulin. Without keys to open the gates,
glucose cannot enter to provide energy for the cell and builds up in the
bloodstream, even as the cell faces internal starvation. As a result,
patients continually lose weight, no matter how much they eat, since they
are unable to properly use the available food energy. Unused, this
glucose is eventually excreted in the urine, even as the patient wastes
away. Untreated, type 1 diabetes is usually fatal.
When people without type 1 diabetes eat, insulin rises, and glucose
enters the cell to help us meet our immediate energy needs. The excess
food energy is stored away for later use. Some carbohydrates,
particularly sugars and refined grains, raise blood glucose effectively,
which stimulates the release of insulin. Dietary protein also raises insulin
levels, but not blood glucose, by simultaneously raising other hormones,
such as glucagon and incretins. Dietary fats only minimally raise both
blood glucose and insulin levels.
Another of insulin’s key roles is to signal to the liver that nutrients are
on their way. The intestinal bloodstream, known as the portal circulation,
delivers amino acids and sugars directly to the liver for processing. On
the other hand, fatty acids are absorbed directly and do not pass through
the liver before entering into the regular bloodstream. Since liver
processing is not required, insulin signaling is not necessary and insulin
levels remain relatively unchanged by pure dietary fats.
Once our immediate energy needs have been met, insulin gives the
signal to store food energy for later use. Our body uses dietary
carbohydrates to provide energy for working muscles and the central
nervous system, but the excess also provides glucose to the liver. Amino
acids are used to produce protein, such as muscle, skin, and connective
tissue, but the liver converts the excess into glucose, since amino acids
cannot be stored directly.
Food energy is stored in two forms: glycogen and body fat. Excess
glucose, whether derived from protein or from carbohydrates, is strung
together in long chains to form the molecule glycogen, which is stored in
the liver. It can be converted to and from glucose easily and released into
the bloodstream for use by any cell in the body. Skeletal muscles also
store their own glycogen, but only the muscle cell storing the glycogen
can use it for energy.
The liver can only stockpile a limited amount of glycogen. Once it is
full, the excess glucose is turned into fat by a process called de novo
lipogenesis (DNL). De novo means “from new” and lipogenesis means
“making new fat,” so this term means literally “to make new fat.” Insulin
triggers the liver to turn excess glucose into new fat in the form of
triglyceride molecules. The newly created fat is exported out of the liver
to be stored in fat cells to supply the body with energy when it is required.
In essence, the body stores excess food energy in the form of sugar
(glycogen) or body fat. Insulin is the signal to stop burning sugar and fat
and to start storing it instead.
This normal process occurs when we stop eating (and begin fasting),
which is when the body needs this source of energy. Although we often
use the word fasting to describe periods in which we deliberately limit
certain foods or abstain from eating altogether, such as before a medical
procedure or in conjunction with a religious holiday, it simply applies to
any period between snacks or meals when we are not eating. During
periods of fasting, our body relies on its stored energy, meaning that it
breaks down glycogen and fat.
Figure 5.1. Storage of food energy as sugar or fat
Several hours after a meal, blood glucose drops and insulin levels
begin to fall. To provide energy, the liver starts to break down the stored
glycogen into component glucose molecules and releases it into general
circulation in the blood. This is merely the glycogen-storage process in
reverse. This happens most nights, assuming you don’t eat at night.
Glycogen is easily available but in limited supply. During a short-term
fast (twenty-four to thirty-six hours), glycogen will provide all the glucose
necessary for normal body functioning. During a prolonged fast, the liver
will manufacture new glucose from stored body fat. This process is called
gluconeogenesis, meaning literally “the making of new sugar.” In
essence, fat is burned to release energy. This is merely the fat-storage
process in reverse.
Figure 5.2. Gluconeogenesis: The reverse of the glycogen storage process
This energy storage-and-release process happens every day.
Normally this well-designed, balanced system keeps itself in check. We
eat, insulin goes up, and we store energy as glycogen and fat. We fast,
insulin goes down, and we use our stored glycogen and fat. As long as
feeding (insulin high) is balanced with fasting (insulin low), no overall fat
is gained.
Insulin has another role related to storage. When the liver is full of
glycogen, there is no room for the newly created fat from DNL. These
triglyceride molecules are packaged together with specialized proteins,
called lipoproteins, which are made in the liver and exported into the
bloodstream as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Insulin activates the
hormone lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which signals offsite fat cells, called
adipocytes, to remove the triglycerides from the blood for longterm
storage. In this manner, excess carbohydrates and protein can be stored
long term offsite as body fat.
Excessive insulin drives fat accumulation and obesity. How? If our
feeding periods predominate over our fasting periods, then the ensuing
insulin dominance leads to fat accumulation. Too much insulin signals the
liver to keep admitting glucose, resulting in more production of new fat via
DNL. Normally, if periods of high insulin (feeding) alternate with periods of
low insulin (fasting), weight remains stable. If high insulin persists, the
body receives the constant signal to store food energy as body fat.
INSULIN: THE CAUSE OF WEIGHT GAIN AND OBESITY
INSULIN IS PRESCRIBED to lower blood glucose in both type 1 and type 2
diabetes. Virtually every patient taking insulin and every prescribing
physician knows full well that weight gain is the main side effect. This is
strong evidence that hyperinsulinemia, high levels of insulin in the blood,
directly causes weight gain. But there is other corroborating evidence as
well.
Insulinomas are rare tumors that continually secrete very high levels
of insulin. These cause low blood glucose and persistent weight gain,
underscoring insulin’s influence once again. Surgical removal of these
tumors results in weight loss. Similarly, sulfonylureas are diabetic
medications that stimulate the body to produce more of its own insulin.
With insulin stimulation, weight gain is the main side effect. Although the
thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug class, used to treat type 2 diabetes, does not
increase insulin levels, it does increase insulin’s effect. The result? Lower
blood glucose, but also weight gain.
Weight gain, however, is not an inevitable consequence of treating
diabetes. Currently, metformin is the most widely prescribed medication
worldwide for type 2 diabetes. Rather than increasing insulin, it blocks the
liver’s production of glucose (gluconeogenesis) and therefore reduces
blood glucose. It successfully treats type 2 diabetes without increasing
insulin and, therefore, does not lead to weight gain.
Where excessively high insulin levels lead to weight gain, excessively
low insulin levels lead to weight loss. Remember, patients with untreated
type 1 diabetes have pathologically low insulin levels and no matter how
many calories they ingest, they cannot gain any weight. Without normal
levels of insulin, these patients cannot properly use or store food energy
and, untreated, they waste away and die. With the replacement of insulin,
these patients gain weight once again.
Increasing insulin causes weight gain. Decreasing insulin causes
weight loss. These are not merely correlations but direct causal factors.
Our hormones, mostly insulin, ultimately set our body weight and level of
body fat. Remember, obesity is a hormonal imbalance, not a caloric one.
THE CARBOHYDRATE-INSULIN HYPOTHESIS
HYPERINSULINEMIA CAUSES OBESITY. This point is crucial because it
immediately makes obvious that successful treatment of obesity depends
upon lowering insulin levels. Highly refined, processed carbohydrates—
sugars, flour, bread, pasta, muffins, donuts, rice, and potatoes—are well
known to raise blood glucose and insulin production. If these highly
refined carbohydrates were the main cause of hyperinsulinemia, they
would also be the prime cause of weight gain. This theory of obesity is
known as the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis. It forms the rational basis
for many low-carbohydrate diets, such as the Atkins diet. By eliminating
many of the “fattening” carbohydrates, we lower insulin levels and
prevent weight gain.
Figure 5.3. Hormonal obesity I: Hyperinsulinemia causes obesity
As you read the coming chapters, watch the progression of the “Hormonal Obesity” diagrams
from this one through Figures 5.4, 6.3, 7.2, 8.1, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4). Reviewed in sequence,
these diagrams illustrate how the building blocks of the metabolic syndrome stack up over time.
The first low-carbohydrate diet dates all the way back to the mid-
nineteenth century. In 1863, William Banting (1796–1878), an English
undertaker, published the pamphlet Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to
the Public,1 which is often considered the world’s first diet book.
Weighing 202 pounds (91.6 kilograms), Banting had tried unsuccessfully
to lose weight by eating less and exercising more. But, just like today’s
dieters, he was unsuccessful.
On the advice of his surgeon, Banting tried a new approach. When he
strenuously avoided the bread, milk, beer, sweets, and potatoes that had
previously made up a large portion of his diet, he lost weight and
successfully kept it off. For most of the next century, diets low in refined
carbohydrates were accepted as the standard treatment for obesity.
For all the success of low-carb diets, the carbohydrate-insulin
hypothesis remains incomplete. While refined carbohydrates are certainly
an important contributor to hyperinsulinemia, they are not the only
contributor. There are many other significant influences. One of the most
important is insulin resistance.
As we’ve seen, insulin acts like a key to open a gate for glucose to
enter the cell. But sometimes, in a state of insulin resistance, the usual
levels of insulin are not sufficient and glucose piles up in the bloodstream
because it cannot get into the cells. To compensate, the body produces
more insulin to overcome this resistance and force the blood glucose
inside. The effect is to restore normal blood glucose levels but at a cost
of persistent hyperinsulinemia. We care about insulin resistance so much
because this compensatory hyperinsulinemia drives overall weight gain.
But here’s the million-dollar question: How does this insulin resistance
develop in the first place?
Figure 5.4. Hormonal obesity II: Insulin resistance causes hyperinsulinemia
INSULIN RESISTANCE:
THE OVERFLOW
PHENOMENON
OBESITY TYPICALLY PRECEDES the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by a decade
or more. Obese but otherwise normal (nondiabetic) patients have
substantially increased insulin resistance compared to lean patients.
Fasting insulin, a measure of the amount of insulin in the blood that
reflects underlying insulin resistance, increases through the spectrum of
obesity, prediabetes, and then type 2 diabetes (see Figure 6.1).1
This suggests that obesity could be the root cause of increased
insulin resistance. But despite spending millions of dollars and doing
decades of intensive research on possible hormonal mediators between
obesity and insulin resistance, no causal link could be made. After all, if
obesity causes insulin resistance, how could type 2 diabetes develop in
normal-weight patients? And why do so many obese people not develop
type 2 diabetes?
Figure 6.1. Changes in insulin as obesity progresses toward type 2 diabetes2
The converse, the idea that insulin resistance causes obesity, is
implausible since obesity typically predates insulin resistance. The only
remaining possibility is that some X factor is the underlying cause of both
obesity and insulin resistance. The connection, as we shall see, is too
much insulin. The X factor is hyperinsulinemia.
Figure 6.2. Hyperinsulinemia: The X factor causing both obesity and insulin resistance
RESISTANCE AS A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM
THE HUMAN BODY follows the fundamental biological principle of
homeostasis. If things change too far in one direction, the body reacts by
changing in the opposite direction to try to return to its original state. For
instance, if we become very cold, the body adapts by shivering to
generate more body heat. If we become very hot, the body sweats to cool
itself. Adaptability is a prerequisite for survival and generally holds true
for all biological systems.
Resistance is simply another word for this adaptability. The body
resists change out of its comfort range by adapting to it. Exposure
creates resistance. Excessively high and prolonged levels of anything
provoke resistance by the body. This is a normal phenomenon. Consider
the following.
Laura was only 25 when she was diagnosed with an insulinoma,3 a
rare tumor that secretes abnormally large amounts of insulin in the
absence of any other significant disease. This condition forces glucose
into the cells, causing recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, or low blood
glucose. As a result, Laura was constantly hungry and, as insulin is a
major driver of obesity, she soon began to gain weight.4 Her glucose
levels were too low to maintain adequate brain function, which led to
problems with concentration and coordination. One night, as she was
driving, she lost control of her feet and narrowly avoided an accident. She
had experienced a seizure related to hypoglycemia.
Laura’s symptoms may appear severe, but they would have been
much worse if her body had not taken protective steps. As her insulin
levels increased, insulin resistance increased in lock step. Without insulin
resistance, her high insulin levels would rapidly have led to very, very low
blood glucose and death. Since the body doesn’t want to die (and neither
do we), it protects itself by developing insulin resistance, demonstrating
homeostasis. The resistance develops naturally to shield against the
unusually high insulin levels. Insulin causes insulin resistance.
Fortunately, the correct diagnosis was soon made and she had corrective
surgery. With the tumor removed, insulin resistance dramatically
reverses, as do associated conditions.5
Reversing the high insulin levels also reverses insulin resistance.
Exposure creates resistance. Removing the stimulus also removes the
resistance. This rare disease gives us a vital clue in understanding the
cause of insulin resistance.
HOW RESISTANCE WORKS
HOMEOSTASIS IS SO fundamental to survival that the body will find many
different ways to develop resistance. Survival depends on it. Let’s take a
look at a few different resistance mechanisms.
Noise resistance
THE VERY FIRST time you yell at somebody, they jump back and pay
attention. Incessant yelling, though, soon negates its effect. In essence,
they have developed resistance. The boy who cried wolf soon learned
that the villagers became resistant to its effect. Exposure creates
resistance.
Removing the stimulus removes the resistance. What happens when
the yelling stops? If the boy stopped crying wolf for a month, the villagers
would start listening again. This prolonged silence reverses the
resistance. The next time he cries wolf, it will have an immediate effect.
Have you ever watched a baby sleep in a crowded, noisy airport? The
ambient noise is very loud, but constant, and the baby sleeps soundly, as
it has become resistant to the noise. That same baby sleeping in a quiet
house might awaken at the slightest creak of the floorboards. This is
every parent’s worst nightmare. Even though it is not loud, the noise is
very noticeable, as the baby has no resistance. The baby immediately
wakes up crying, to the parents’ dismay.
Antibiotic resistance
WHEN NEW ANTIBIOTICS are introduced, they eradicate virtually all the
bacteria they’re designed to kill. Over time, most bacteria develop the
ability to survive high doses of these antibiotics, which turns them into
drug-resistant “superbugs.” As the superbugs multiply and become more
prevalent, the antibiotic loses its effectiveness. This is a large and
growing problem in many urban hospitals worldwide. Every single
antibiotic has lost effectiveness due to resistance.
Antibiotic resistance is not a new phenomenon. Scottish biologist
Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 and mass production
began in 1942, with funds from the U.S. and British governments, for use
during World War II. In his 1945 Nobel lecture, “Penicillin,” Dr. Fleming
correctly predicted the emergence of resistance two years before the first
cases were reported.
How did Dr. Fleming so confidently predict this development? He
understood the fundamental biological principle of homeostasis. A
biological system that becomes disturbed tries to go back to its original
state. As we use an antibiotic more and more, organisms resistant to it
are naturally selected to survive and reproduce. Eventually, these
resistant organisms dominate, and the antibiotic becomes useless.
Persistent, high-level use of antibiotics causes antibiotic resistance.
Exposure creates resistance.
Removing the stimulus removes the resistance. Unfortunately, the
knee-jerk reaction of many doctors is just the opposite: to prescribe more
antibiotics to overcome the resistance, which backfires and creates even
more resistance. Preventing antibiotic resistance means severely
restricting their use. This has led many hospitals to develop stewardship
programs to preserve the effect of the most powerful antibiotics by using
them only in life-threatening situations. Lowering the exposure of bacteria
to the antibiotic creates less resistance, which can save lives.
Viral resistance
RESISTANCE TO VIRUSES such as diphtheria, measles, chicken pox, or polio
develops from the viral infection itself. Before the development of
vaccines, it was popular to hold “measles parties” or “pox parties,” where
unaffected children would play with a child who was actively infected with
the virus in order to deliberately expose them. Not the funnest of parties,
but having measles once protects a child for life.
Exposure creates resistance.
Vaccines work on this exact principle. Edward Jenner, a young doctor
working in rural England, heard the common tale of milkmaids developing
resistance to the fatal smallpox virus because they had contracted the
milder cowpox virus. In 1796, he deliberately infected a young boy with
cowpox and observed how he was subsequently protected from
smallpox, a similar virus. By being inoculated with a dead or weakened
virus, we build up immunity without actually causing the full disease. In
other words, viruses cause viral resistance.
Drug resistance
WHEN A DRUG such as cocaine is taken for the first time, there is an intense
reaction—the “high.” With each subsequent use of the drug, this high
becomes progressively less intense. Drug abusers may start to take
larger doses to achieve the same high. Through repeated and prolonged
exposure, the body develops resistance to the drug’s effects, a condition
called tolerance. People can build up resistance to many different types
of drugs, including narcotics, marijuana, nicotine, caffeine, alcohol,
benzodiazepines (tranquilizers), and nitroglycerin. Again, exposure
creates resistance.
Removing the stimulus removes the resistance. In order to restore
sensitivity to the medication, it is necessary to have a period of low drug
use. If you stop drinking alcohol for a year, the first drink afterwards will
have its full effect again.
What do all of these examples have in common? In the case of noise,
stimulus fatigue is the mechanism of resistance. The human ear
responds to changes rather than the absolute noise levels. In the case of
antibiotics, the natural selection of resistant organisms is the mechanism.
The bacteria that adapt to the drugs are the ones that survive and
multiply. In the case of viruses, the development of antibodies is the
mechanism of resistance. In the case of drug resistance, or
desensitization, a decrease in the number of cell receptors is the
mechanism. While the mechanism in each of these cases may differ, the
end result is always the same. That’s the point. Homeostasis is so
fundamental to survival that biological systems always find a way to
compensate. Exposure creates resistance.
And what does this tell us about insulin resistance? Insulin causes
insulin resistance.
HOW INSULIN CAUSES INSULIN RESISTANCE
HORMONES, SUCH AS insulin, act much like drugs when it comes to
resistance. Both act upon cell surface receptors, and they show the same
phenomenon of resistance. In the case of insulin, prolonged and
excessive exposure to this hormone—hyperinsulinemia—causes insulin
resistance. Proving it experimentally is quite simple. Take a group of
healthy volunteers, give them persistent, high doses of insulin, and look
for resistance to develop. Luckily, all the experiments have already been
done.
In one study, a forty-hour constant insulin infusion into a group of
healthy young people increased insulin resistance by 15 percent.6 In a
similar experiment, a ninety-six-hour constant intravenous infusion of
insulin into a group of healthy young people increased insulin resistance
by 20 to 40 percent.7 The implications of these results are simply
staggering. Giving normal but persistent amounts of insulin alone to
these healthy young people made them insulin resistant. Insulin causes
insulin resistance. That is, I can make anybody insulin resistant. All I
need to do is give them enough insulin.
In type 2 diabetes, giving large doses of insulin produces increased
insulin resistance. In one study, patients initially not taking insulin were
titrated up to a very high dose of 100 units of insulin per day.8 The higher
the insulin dose, the more insulin resistance they developed—a direct
causal relationship, as inseparable as a shadow is from a body. Even as
blood glucose levels got better, the diabetes was getting worse. Insulin
causes insulin resistance.
However, high hormonal levels by themselves cannot cause
resistance or we would all quickly develop crippling levels of resistance.
Our bodies naturally defend against resistance by secreting our
hormones in short bursts. High levels of hormones are released at
specific times to produce a specific effect. Afterwards, the levels quickly
drop and stay very low. This is the body’s daily circadian rhythm. The
prolonged low periods of hormone ensure that resistance does not
develop.
For example, the hormone melatonin, produced by the pineal gland to
regulate our sleep and wake cycles, is virtually undetectable during the
day. As night falls, it increases to peak in the early morning hours.
Cortisol, produced by the adrenal glands to regulate stress, spikes just
before we wake up and then drops down to low levels. Growth hormone,
produced in the pituitary gland to help us regenerate cells, is secreted
mostly in deep sleep and then falls to undetectable levels during the day.
Parathyroid hormone, which regulates bone metabolism, peaks in the
early morning. The periodic release of these and other hormones is
essential in preventing resistance.
Hormone levels generally stay very low. Every so often a brief pulse
of the specific hormone, often triggered by the circadian rhythm, comes
along to create maximum effect. After it passes, our levels are very low
again. The brief pulse of hormone is over long before resistance has a
chance to develop. The body does not continuously cry wolf. When it
does on occasion, we experience the full effect.
For resistance to develop, two essential factors are required: high
hormonal levels and constant stimulus. Normally, insulin is released in
bursts, preventing insulin resistance from developing. But when the body
is constantly bombarded with insulin, resistance develops.
It should be obvious by now that, since resistance develops in
response to high, persistent levels of a stimulus, raising the dose only
leads to more resistance. It’s a vicious, self-reinforcing cycle: exposure
creates resistance. Resistance leads to higher exposure. Higher
exposure increases resistance. When constant high levels of insulin “yell”
for glucose to enter the cell, it has progressively less effect (insulin
resistance). The body’s knee-jerk reaction is to produce even more
insulin—to yell even louder. The louder it yells, the less effect it has.
Hyperinsulinemia drives the vicious cycle. Hyperinsulinemia leads to
insulin resistance, which leads to worsening hyperinsulinemia.
Figure 6.3. Hormonal obesity III: High insulin → resistance → higher insulin
The cycle keeps going around and around, until the insulin levels in
the body are extremely high, which drives weight gain and obesity. The
longer the cycle continues, the worse it becomes, which is why obesity
and insulin resistance are so time dependent. People can be stuck in this
vicious cycle for decades, developing significant insulin resistance.
Resistance then leads to high insulin levels, which are independent of
diet.
But the story gets worse. Insulin resistance leads to higher fasting
insulin levels. Fasting insulin levels are normally low. Now, instead of
starting the day with low insulin after the nightly fast, we start with high
insulin. The consequences are dire: the fat get fatter. As insulin
resistance becomes a larger and larger part of the problem, it can, in fact,
become a major driver of high insulin levels. Obesity drives itself.
The fact that insulin resistance leads to compensatory
hyperinsulinemia has been long accepted. But the novel notion that
hyperinsulinemia also causes insulin resistance is slowly gaining
acceptance. Dr. Barbara Corkey, the 2011 Banting Medal winner from
Boston University’s School of Medicine, called her lecture,
“Hyperinsulinemia is the root cause of insulin resistance, obesity and
diabetes.”9 The Banting Medal is the American Diabetes Association’s
highest scientific award, so these are not merely the musings of a fringe
group.
The hallmark of type 2 diabetes is elevated insulin resistance. Both
obesity and type 2 diabetes are manifestations of the same underlying
problem: hyperinsulinemia. Their close relationship has given rise to the
term “diabesity,” which implicitly acknowledges that they are one and the
same disease.
Figure 6.4. Hyperinsulinemia: The link between obesity and diabetes
HYPERINSULINEMIA AND THE OVERFLOW PHENOMENON
INSULIN RESISTANCE OCCURS when blood glucose remains elevated despite
normal or high levels of insulin, since the cells are resisting insulin’s pleas
to take up glucose. But how does hyperinsulinemia cause this
phenomenon?
The currently held lock-and-key paradigm suggests that the key
(insulin) opens the lock (cell surface receptor) to allow glucose inside,
and that once you remove the key (insulin), blood glucose can no longer
enter the cell. With insulin resistance, we imagine that the lock and key
no longer fit together very well. The key only partially opens the lock and
not very easily, so glucose, which cannot enter normally, instead piles up
outside, in the blood. As less glucose enters the cell, it faces a state of
internal starvation and the body produces more insulin. Since each key
works less efficiently, the body compensates by producing more keys.
This hyperinsulinemia ensures that enough glucose gets into the cells to
meet its energy requirement. It’s a nice, neat theory. Too bad it has no
basis in reality.
Is the problem the key (insulin) or the lock (insulin receptor)? Well,
neither. The molecular structure of both insulin and the insulin receptor is
completely normal in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, something must be
gumming up the lock-and-key mechanism. But what? Despite decades of
intensive research, no plausible culprit has been positively identified.
Recall that insulin goes up when you eat and acts predominantly in
the liver to help store incoming food energy. Insulin instructs the liver to
do two things:
1.  Stop burning stored food energy (e.g. body fat).
2.  Store incoming food energy as glycogen or produce new fat via de
novo lipogenesis (DNL).
If the cell were truly resistant to insulin and suffering internal
starvation, both actions should be simultaneously blunted. This certainly
holds true for the first action of insulin. Insulin yells at the liver to stop
making new glucose, but the liver continues to pump it out. Glucose spills
out into the blood.
However, the second action of insulin is paradoxically enhanced. If
glucose cannot enter the cell, causing internal starvation, then the liver
has no substrate to create new fat and DNL should shut down. How can
the liver make new fat from glucose if it has no glucose? It’s like trying to
build a brick house with no bricks. Even if you have construction workers,
it is impossible.
With insulin resistance, DNL actually increases, so insulin’s effect is
not blunted but accelerated. So much new fat is being generated that
there is nowhere to put it. This excess fat accumulates in the liver, where
there normally should be none at all. With insulin resistance, liver fat
should be low, not high. But type 2 diabetes is almost always associated
with excessive fat accumulation in the liver.
How can the liver selectively resist one of insulin’s effects yet
accelerate the other? And in the very same cell, in response to the very
same levels of insulin, with the very same insulin receptor? Despite
decades of ongoing research and millions of dollars, all the world’s top
researchers were still stumped by this central paradox of insulin
resistance until they realized that the old gummed-up, lock-and-key
paradigm of insulin resistance with internal starvation was incorrect. The
vital clue is that insulin itself causes insulin resistance, which means that
the primary problem is not insulin resistance but the hyperinsulinemia
that caused it.
Insulin resistance only refers to the fact that, for a given amount of
insulin, it is more difficult to move glucose into the cell. So what if the
glucose cannot enter the cell because it is already overflowing? The
paradigm of insulin resistance as an overflow phenomenon resolves the
central paradox.
HOW THE OVERFLOW PHENOMENON WORKS
PICTURE A SUBWAY train at rush hour. The train stops at a station, gets the
all-clear signal from the conductor, and opens its doors to let passengers
on. All the passengers enter the train without difficulty and the platform is
empty as the train pulls away.
The cell is like the subway train, insulin is like the conductor, and the
glucose molecules are like the passengers. When insulin gives the
proper signal, the gates open and glucose enters the cell in an orderly
fashion without much difficulty. With an insulin-resistant cell, insulin
signals the cell to open the gate, but no glucose enters. Glucose
accumulates in the blood, unable to get inside. What has happened?
Consider our train analogy. The train pulls into the station and
receives the signal to open the doors, but no passengers get on. This is
“conductor” resistance. As the train pulls away, many passengers are left
standing on the platform. Under the lock-and-key paradigm, the
conductor’s signal fails to open the subway doors fully because
something is jamming the mechanism. Passengers can’t get through the
doors and they are left on the platform while the empty train pulls away.
The overflow phenomenon suggests a different possibility. The train
pulls into the station but it is already jam-packed with passengers from
the previous stop. When the conductor gives the signal to open the door,
the passengers waiting on the platform cannot get on because the train is
already full. From our view on the outside, we only see that passengers
cannot enter the train and conclude that the door did not open.
The same situation occurs in the liver cell. If high insulin levels have
already jammed the cell full of glucose, no more can enter even if insulin
opens the gate. From the outside, we can only say that the cell is now
resistant to insulin’s urging to move glucose inside.
In our train analogy, one way to pack more people into the train is to
hire “subway pushers.” In New York City in the 1920s, people were
forcibly shoved into the packed trains. While this practice has died out in
North America, it still exists in Japan. When passengers are left standing
on the platform, “passenger arrangement staff” push more people onto
the train.
Hyperinsulinemia is the body’s subway pusher. It shoves glucose into
the already stuffed cell. When glucose is left outside, the body produces
extra insulin to forcibly push more glucose into the cell. This tactic works
at first, but as more and more glucose is forced inside the overstuffed
cell, more force is required. Insulin resistance causes compensatory
hyperinsulinemia. But what was the initial cause? Hyperinsulinemia. It’s a
vicious cycle.
Let’s think about the liver cell. At the beginning, the cell (train) is
empty. If equal amounts of glucose (passengers) enter and leave, then
everything works normally. If feeding (insulin high) and fasting (insulin
low) periods are balanced, insulin resistance does not develop.
With persistent hyperinsulinemia, glucose (passengers) keeps
entering the cell (train) and not leaving. Over time, the cell (train)
overflows and glucose (passengers) cannot enter even when the cell
surface receptor (door) is open. The cell is now insulin resistant. To
compensate, the body produces more insulin (subway pushers) to force
more glucose inside, but over time this only makes it worse by creating
higher insulin resistance.
Insulin resistance creates hyperinsulinemia, and vice versa. The
vicious cycle goes around and around. The cell is not in a state of internal
starvation; instead, it is overflowing with glucose. As it spills out of the
cell, blood glucose levels increase.
And what happens to new fat production, or DNL? The cell is overfilled
with glucose, not empty, so there is no reduction of DNL. Instead, the cell
produces as much new fat as possible to relieve the internal congestion
of glucose. If more new fat is created than can be exported, fat backs up
in the liver, an organ not designed for fat storage. The result is fatty liver.
This overflow paradigm perfectly explains the central paradox.
Looking at blood glucose, the cell appears insulin resistant. Looking at
DNL, the cell appears to have enhanced insulin sensitivity. This happens
in the liver cell, with the same level of insulin and the same insulin
receptors. The paradox has been resolved by understanding this new
paradigm of insulin resistance. The cell is not internally starved; it is
overloaded with glucose. The physical manifestation of that cell—
overstuffed with excess glucose, now turned into fat via DNL—can be seen
as fatty infiltration of the liver.
Figure 6.5. Too much sugar → fatty liver → insulin resistance
Insulin resistance is predominantly a glucose overflow problem of the
overstuffed, fatty liver. As the first stop for metabolism of ingested
nutrients, the liver is naturally the epicenter of health problems related to
excess consumption. Insulin resistance is primarily caused by excessive
fatty infiltration of the liver caused in turn by excessive glucose and
fructose consumption. In other words, too much sugar causes fatty liver,
the key problem of insulin resistance, as Figure 6.5 shows.
PHILIP
Philip, 46, had been admitted to hospital to receive intravenous
antibiotics for a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer. He’d already
had the ulcer for ten months and, despite constant dressings
and care from the plastic surgeon, it had become infected. At
the time, he had a five-year history of type 2 diabetes and was
taking sitagliptin and metformin to control his blood glucose. I
spoke with Philip and his father in the hospital about the gravity
of his situation, since non-healing ulcers often destroy the foot,
eventually leading to amputation.
Once Philip completed his antibiotics and was discharged
from the hospital, I asked him to attend the IDM program.
Fasting is a regular part of the Greek Orthodox religion he
practices, and so he quickly understood the logic of our
program. He started fasting once a week for 48 hours, and
within a month he was able to stop taking both of his blood
glucose medications because his readings were normal. His
“chronic, non-healing” ulcer healed within a month.
Philip has been following the IDM program for a year, and
takes no medications. His ulcers have not recurred, he has lost
20 pounds, and his A1C is only 6.5%, which is below the 7.2%
he had achieved even with two medications.
SYBIL
Sibyl, 69, had a ten-year history of type 2 diabetes as well as
high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and triple bypass
surgery. When I met her, she had been taking insulin for five
years and required 70 units daily, in addition to sitagliptin and
metformin to keep her blood glucose in check. She weighed
202 pounds and had a waist circumference of 117 cm, with a
BMI of 35.8.
On the IDM program she started a low-carbohydrate,
healthy-fat diet, along with alternating 24- and 36-hour fasts
every other day. Her doctor carefully managed her insulin dose
to avoid both high and low blood glucose, and closely
monitored her overall health. In two months, she was able to
stop taking all her insulin and also the sitagliptin. Now, six
months into the program, she has lost 30 pounds and 13 cm off
her waist. She is still working toward getting off her diabetes
medications entirely, but her A1C measures 6.2% and her dose
of metformin has been reduced accordingly.
DIABETES, A DISEASE OF DUAL
DEFECTS
THE ENGLISH FRIAR and philosopher, William of Ockham (1287–1347), is
credited with developing the fundamental problem-solving principle
known as lex parsimoniae, or “Ockham’s razor.” This postulate holds that
the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions is often true. In other words,
the simplest explanation is usually correct. Albert Einstein is quoted as
saying, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not
simpler.”
While type 2 diabetes is considered primarily a disease of excessive
insulin resistance, it actually represents two separate physiological
defects. First, insulin resistance, an overflow phenomenon, is caused by
fatty infiltration of the liver and muscle. Insulin resistance develops early
in the disease process, typically preceding the diagnosis of type 2
diabetes by a decade or more, but blood glucose remains relatively
normal because the pancreatic beta cells increase insulin production to
balance. This compensatory hyperinsulinemia forces the glucose into the
cells, keeping blood glucose levels normal.
Figure 7.1. Change in blood glucose leading up to type 2 diabetes1
Without dietary intervention, this insulin resistance almost always
leads to the second problem, beta cell dysfunction. Furthermore, only
insulin resistance and virtually nothing else causes beta cell dysfunction.
Conventional medical wisdom holds that this dysfunction occurs because
of exhaustion and eventual scarring of the insulin-producing cells. This
idea implies that these two phenomena—insulin resistance and beta cell
dysfunction—occur for entirely separate reasons. However, given this
mutually exclusive and intimate relationship, Ockham’s razor suggests
that both defects must surely be caused by the same underlying
mechanism.
Only when insulin production fails to keep pace with increasing
resistance does the blood glucose rise high enough to make the clinical
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Thus, there are two underlying prerequisites
of the disease: elevated insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. The
progression of blood glucose levels in the years preceding the diagnosis
occurs in two distinct phases, reflecting these two distinct abnormalities.2
PHASE 1: HYPERINSULINEMIA / INSULIN RESISTANCE
AS SHOWN IN Figure 7.1, insulin resistance emerges, on average, almost
thirteen years prior to type 2 diabetes. The growing insulin resistance
produces a long gradual rise in blood glucose as the compensatory
hyperinsulinemia prevents a more rapid ascent. For more than a decade,
blood glucose stays relatively normal. In children and adolescents, this
phase can be accelerated: some develop the disease in as little as
twenty-one months.3
Visceral fat deposited in and around the organs4 is the main
contributor to high insulin resistance. The very first place this fat starts to
accumulate, often before insulin resistance becomes noticeable, is the
liver.
Fatty liver
THE LIVER, AS we’ve seen, lies at the nexus of food energy storage and
production. After absorption through the intestines, portal circulation
delivers nutrients directly to the liver. No wonder that, since body fat is
essentially a method of food energy storage, diseases of fat storage
involve the liver intimately.
Remember that all fats are not created equal. Excess dietary fat
bypasses the liver and can be stored anywhere in the body. Fat carried
under the skin (subcutaneous fat) contributes to overall weight and body
mass index but has minimal health consequences. It is cosmetically
undesirable but seems to be otherwise metabolically innocuous.
Excess dietary carbohydrates and protein are stored first in the liver
as glycogen. Once glycogen stores are full, DNL converts glucose to fat,
which can then be exported out of the liver to the rest of the body,
including to fat stores in and around the abdominal organs. When DNL
exceeds the export capacity of the liver, fat accumulates in the liver,
where it contributes to central obesity and has dangerous health
consequences. Too much sugar and insulin, over too long a period of
time, leads to fatty liver.5
Eventually, the overfilled, fatty liver becomes unable to accept any
more glucose and starts becoming insulin resistant. As seen previously,
this insulin resistance is an overflow phenomenon. As shown in Figure
7.2, the cycle proceeds as follows:
1. Hyperinsulinemia causes fatty liver.
2. Fatty liver causes insulin resistance.
3. Insulin resistance leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia.
4. Repeat cycle.
Figure 7.2. Hormonal obesity IV: High insulin → fatty liver → insulin resistance
Fat inside the liver, rather than overall obesity, is the crucial stepping
stone toward insulin resistance and diabetes. Fatty liver is associated at
all stages of insulin resistance from obesity to prediabetes to full-blown
diabetes. And that relationship holds in all racial groups and ethnicities.
Fatty liver is the clearest sign that hyperinsulinemia and insulin
resistance are developing, and one of the earliest. Fatty liver precedes
the clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by ten years or more.6 As the
liver slowly accumulates fat it becomes increasingly insulin resistant.
Fatty liver can be diagnosed by ultrasound, but an increased waist
circumference or waist-to-height ratio is an important clue to its presence.
Blood markers of liver damage also often mirror that slow rise, and this
phase has been termed “the long, silent scream from the liver.”
Two main types of fatty liver disease exist: alcohol-related liver
disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The first is associated, as
the name suggests, with drinking too much alcohol. Since most alcohol is
metabolized solely in the liver, too much, too often forces the body to deal
with the overflow. The result is fatty liver. But a lot of people who develop
fatty liver disease and diabetes are not alcoholics, and it’s only recently
that scientists have begun to understand that connection.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
DR. ALFRED FRÖHLICH from the University of Vienna first began to unravel
the neuro-hormonal basis of obesity in 1890. He described a young boy
with the sudden onset of obesity who was eventually diagnosed with
damage to the hypothalamus area of the brain, which resulted in
intractable weight gain. This established this region as a key regulator of
energy balance.
In rats, injury to the hypothalamic area of the brain could
experimentally produce insatiable appetites and induce obesity.
Researchers quickly noticed something else, too. All these obese
animals shared characteristic liver damage, which was occasionally
severe enough to progress to complete destruction. Genetically obese
mice shared the same liver lesions. Strange, they thought. What does the
liver have to do with obesity?
Dr. Samuel Zelman, a physician at the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Topeka, Kansas, first made the connection in 1952.7
Alcoholism was known to cause fatty liver, but he observed the disease in
a hospital aide who drank, not alcohol, but more than twenty bottles of
Coca-Cola a day! That obesity could cause similar liver damage by itself
was completely unknown at that time. Zelman, aware of the data from
experiments involving rats, spent the next few years tracking down
twenty other obese, non-alcoholic patients with evidence of liver disease
and found they unanimously preferred carbohydrate-rich diets.
Almost thirty years later, Dr. Jürgen Ludwig of the Mayo Clinic also
described twenty patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).8
All these patients also suffered from obesity and obesity-associated
diseases, such as diabetes. There was also varying evidence of liver
damage. Those with NAFLD whose blood tests showed evidence of organ
damage were said to have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a term
derived from steato, which means “fat,” and hepatitis, which means
“inflammation of the liver.” NASH is simply the more serious manifestation
of NAFLD.
At the time of its discovery in 1980, Dr. Ludwig wrote that NAFLD
spared doctors “the embarrassment (or worse) that may result from the
ensuing verbal exchanges.” In other words, the realization that fatty liver
could occur without alcohol saved patients from their doctors’ repeated
accusations that they were lying about their alcohol intake. More
importantly, the new recognition of NAFLD confirmed the extraordinarily
close association between obesity, hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance,
and fatty liver. Where you found one, you almost invariably found the
others.
Obese individuals have five to fifteen times the rate of fatty liver. Up to
85 percent of type 2 diabetics have fatty liver.9 Even without diabetes,
those with insulin resistance alone have higher levels of liver fat.10 NAFLD
is estimated to affect at least two-thirds of those with obesity.11 Moreover,
the incidence of NAFLD in both children and adults has been rising at an
alarming rate,12 increasing in parallel with obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Hepatic steatosis, the deposition of fat in the liver, is consistently one
of the most important markers of insulin resistance.13 In obese children,
rising levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), an important blood marker of
liver damage,14 is directly linked to insulin resistance and the
development of type 2 diabetes. The severity of fatty liver correlates to
prediabetes, insulin resistance, and impairment of beta cell function.
Furthermore, NASH has become one of the leading causes of end stage
liver disease, known as cirrhosis, and one of the top indications for liver
transplant in the Western world. In North America, the prevalence of NASH
is estimated at 23 percent of the entire population.15
This is a truly frightening epidemic. In the space of a single
generation, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has gone from being
unnamed and completely unknown to being the commonest cause of
abnormal liver enzymes and chronic liver disease in the Western world.16
This is the Rocky Balboa of liver diseases.
Figure 7.3. Insulin resistance rises with liver fat17
Why some people have severe fatty infiltration of the liver without
evidence of damage while others have minimal fat and severe damage
remains unknown.
As the liver slowly accumulates fat, insulin resistance escalates in
lockstep. In type 2 diabetic patients, a close correlation exists between
the amount of liver fat and the insulin dose required,18 reflecting greater
insulin resistance. In short, the fattier the liver, the higher the insulin
resistance. Therefore, to understand insulin resistance, we must first
understand how fatty liver develops.
How fatty liver develops
HERE’S A STARTLING fact: I can give you fatty liver. Actually, I can give
anybody fatty liver. What’s the scariest part? This crucial first step toward
type 2 diabetes only takes three weeks!
Excessive glucose and insulin drives new fat production (DNL). If this
occurs faster than the liver can export it out to the adipocytes (fat cells),
fat accumulates in the liver. This condition can be achieved simply by
overeating sugary snacks. Hey presto, fatty liver disease.
Researchers fed overweight volunteers an extra thousand calories of
sugary snacks daily in addition to their regular food consumption.19 This
sounds like a lot, but it only means ingesting an extra two small bags of
candy, a glass of juice, and two cans of Coca-Cola per day. After three
weeks, body weight increased by a relatively insignificant 2 percent.
However, liver fat increased by a whopping 27 percent, caused by an
identical increase in the rate of DNL. This fatty liver was far from benign,
as blood markers of liver damage increased by a similar 30 percent.
But all was not lost. When volunteers returned to their usual diets,
their weight, liver fat, and markers of liver damage all completely
reversed. A mere 4 percent decrease in body weight reduced their liver
fat by 25 percent.
Fatty liver is a completely reversible process. Emptying the liver of its
surplus glucose and dropping insulin levels returns the liver to normal.
Hyperinsulinemia drives DNL, which is the primary determinant of fatty
liver disease. Normalizing insulin levels reverses the fatty liver. Refined
carbohydrates, which cause large increases in insulin, are far more
sinister than dietary fat. High carbohydrate intake can increase DNL
tenfold, whereas high fat consumption, with correspondingly low
carbohydrate intake, does not change hepatic fat production noticeably.20
Specifically, the sugar fructose, rather than glucose, is the main
culprit,21 even though fructose does not produce much insulin response.
The next chapter explains why in more detail. By contrast, in type 1
diabetes, insulin levels are extremely low, causing decreased liver fat.22
Producing fatty liver in animals is simple, too. The delicacy known as
foie gras is the fatty liver of a duck or a goose. Geese naturally develop
large fatty livers to store energy in preparation for the long migration
ahead, but more than four thousand years ago the Egyptians developed
a technique known as gavage. Originally done by hand, this deliberate
overfeeding is now administered using more modern and efficient
methods. A large amount of high-starch corn mash is fed directly into the
goose or duck’s digestive system several times per day through a tube
called an embuc. In just ten to fourteen days, the liver becomes fatty and
enlarged.
Producing foie gras in animals and fatty liver in humans is basically
the same process. Deliberate carbohydrate overfeeding provokes the
high insulin levels necessary to develop fatty liver. In 1977, the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans strongly advised people to eat less fat and
more carbohydrates, such as bread and pasta. The result? Dramatically
increased insulin levels. Little did we know that we were, in essence,
making human foie gras.
Fatty liver is the harbinger of insulin resistance, but it is only the
beginning. The fat within other organs, including the skeletal muscles and
the pancreas,23 also play a leading role in this disease.
Fatty muscle
SKELETAL MUSCLES ARE the large muscle groups, such as the biceps,
triceps, quadriceps, trunk, and gluteal muscles, that we use to move our
limbs voluntarily. This differentiates them from smooth muscles—muscles
such as the heart or diaphragm—which are largely not under voluntary
control. Skeletal muscles burn the bulk of the glucose available after
meals and store their own supply of glycogen to provide quick bursts of
energy. This muscle glycogen is not available for use by other organs of
the body. Normally, little fat is found in skeletal muscle. Fat cells are
specialized for fat storage; muscle cells are not.
With hyperinsulinemia and excess sugar, the liver creates new fat by
DNL and distributes these triglycerides throughout the body. When
adipocytes (fat storage cells) become overwhelmed, skeletal muscles
also take up the fat, leading ultimately to fat deposits between muscle
fibers. The technical term is intramyocyte lipid accumulation, but it could
easily be called fatty muscle.
We can see this process of developing fatty muscle more clearly in
farm-raised cattle, where the accumulation of fat between muscle fibers
is called delicious! The streaks of fat are clearly visible as marbling—the
intermingling of fat with lean muscle. As the meat cooks, the fat melts,
making the beef more tender, moist, and flavorful, as it literally bastes
itself. For this reason, well-marbled beef commands a premium price.
Kobe beef, the ultra-premium Japanese delicacy, is prized for its high
degree of marbling. The United States Department of Agriculture grades
beef based on the degree of marbling. Prime beef, the highest and most
expensive grade, has the most marbling.
Cattle ranchers know that marbling depends almost entirely on diet.
Cows are ruminants, which means they normally eat grass and do not
develop marbling. The result is a more flavorful but less tender steak.
However, a grain-heavy diet increases the growth rate as well as the
marbling. For this reason, many grass-fed cows are “finished” with a
period of corn feeding to develop the desired fatty muscle, or marbling.
Carbohydrate-heavy diets cause fatty muscle. It’s no secret in cattle, and
it works just as well in humans.
Fatty liver produces insulin resistance in the liver. In the same
manner, fatty muscle produces insulin resistance in skeletal muscles.
Hyperinsulinemia forces too much fat and glucose inside the skeletal
muscles. They become completely full, so insulin cannot push any more
inside. This is the same overflow phenomenon. Since the skeletal
muscles are so large, they contribute significantly to overall insulin
resistance in the body.24
Fat deposition in skeletal muscles, obesity, and severity of insulin
resistance are closely related.25 Muscles from obese subjects take up
fatty acid at an equal rate to lean subjects but burn it at only half the
speed, leading to greater accumulation of fat within the muscles. Weight
loss can partially rectify this problem.
Why can’t the muscle just burn off this fat? The answer lies in the
biochemical process known as the Randle cycle.
The Randle cycle
DR. PHILIP RANDLE first described the glucose–fatty acid, or Randle, cycle in
1963.26 Working with isolated heart and skeletal muscle cell
preparations, Randle demonstrated that cells burning glucose could not
burn fat and vice versa. Furthermore, this phenomenon did not require
the assistance of insulin or any other hormones. Your body simply cannot
use both fuels simultaneously. You either burn sugar or fat, but not both.
Most cells can use fat directly for energy but certain key cells, notably
the brain, cannot. During the fasting state, large organs such as the liver,
heart, pancreas, and skeletal muscles burn fat to conserve what little
glucose is available for the brain. This essential survival mechanism
maximizes the time humans can survive without eating. Since the liver
cannot produce enough new glucose by the process of gluconeogenesis
for the entire body, the Randle cycle helps conserve glucose for where it
is needed the most. The liver also produces ketone bodies from fat,
which provides up to 75 percent of the brain’s energy requirements, and
further conserves glucose.
The body’s ability to block the use of glucose by relying on fatty acids
instead has also been called physiological insulin resistance. When the
body is mostly burning fat, such as during very low–carbohydrate diets or
fasting, it cannot burn glucose. Therefore, if you start to eat
carbohydrates, the cells temporarily cannot handle the glucose load and
your blood glucose levels rise. This phenomenon looks like insulin
resistance but is not really the same mechanism at all. As insulin rises,
the body switches to burning glucose and the blood glucose levels fall
back.
The opposite is also true. When the body is burning glucose, it cannot
burn fat, but saves stored fat for later consumption. The Randle cycle
ensures the skeletal muscle cells cannot simply burn off the excess fat
when they are fully saturated with glucose. They are burning glucose, not
fat, so it accumulates. Voilà! Fatty muscle and insulin resistance.
Fatty muscle and fatty liver lead to rising insulin resistance, provoking
the compensatory hyperinsulinemia that keeps blood glucose normal. But
as we’ve seen, this cycle eventually leads to the development of more
insulin resistance in a classic, self-reinforcing cycle. Over time, the insulin
levels march relentlessly higher, as does the insulin resistance.
Ultimately, something’s gotta give. Enter phase 2.
PHASE 2: BETA CELL DYSFUNCTION
BLOOD GLUCOSE RISES quickly when the pancreatic beta cells responsible
for insulin production cannot keep pace with rising insulin resistance.
When this compensatory mechanism fails, it only takes one to two years
before a diagnosis of full-blown type 2 diabetes. Over time, insulin
production peaks and eventually starts to fall.27 The progressive decline
in insulin production is often called beta cell dysfunction, or sometimes
pancreatic burnout. But what causes this burnout?
Many researchers suggest hyperglycemia destroys beta cells. But
there’s an obvious and insurmountable problem with this theory. As
insulin resistance develops, blood glucose stays relatively controlled.
Glucose doesn’t rise significantly until after beta cells fail. The beta cell
dysfunction causes the high blood glucose, not the other way around.
The prevailing hypothesis is that the beta cells are simply worn out
from overproducing insulin for so long. Like a rickety old engine that has
been revved too many times, the excessive chronic workload has caused
irreversible damage. However, three main problems exist with this
paradigm of chronic progressive scarring of the pancreas.
First, beta cell function has been proven to be fully reversible. Dr. Roy
Taylor of Newcastle University in the U.K. demonstrated pancreatic
function recovery with an ultra-low calorie diet.28 The fact that weight loss
can reverse type 2 diabetes also implies reversibility to the beta cell
function. Simply, the beta cells are not burnt out.
Second, with excessive use, the body generally responds with
increased, not decreased, function. If you exercise a muscle, it gets
stronger; it doesn’t burn out. With overactive secretion, glands generally
get larger, not smaller. If you think and study a lot, you increase your
knowledge; your brain doesn’t burn out. The same holds true for the
insulin-producing cells. They should grow larger (hypertrophy), not
smaller (atrophy).
Finally, beta cell burnout implies that damage occurs only due to
longstanding excessive use. It takes many decades of overactivity to
produce scarring and fibrosis. The rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes in
children and adolescents clearly proves this concept false. With type 2
diabetes now being diagnosed in children as young as three years old, it
is inconceivable that any part of their body has already burned out.
What causes the beta cell dysfunction? Since this defect naturally
follows insulin resistance, Ockham’s razor suggests that the beta cell
dysfunction should share the same basic mechanism as the insulin
resistance. Specifically, the problem is fatty infiltration of organs, and
recent research has identified the likely culprit. During the first phase,
fatty liver and fatty muscles create increased insulin resistance. In the
second phase, fatty pancreas creates beta cell dysfunction. The
pancreas is not burnt out; it is merely clogged with fat.
Fatty pancreas
HYPERINSULINEMIA CAUSES FATTY liver, and to relieve the backup, this newly
created fat is exported out of the liver to other parts of the body. Some of
it ends up in adipocytes, and some in the skeletal muscle. The pancreas
also becomes heavily infiltrated with fat.
The relationship between pancreatic weight and total body weight was
first noted in 1920. Pancreases from obese cadavers contained almost
double the fat of lean cadavers.29 By the 1960s, advances in non-
invasive imaging allowed direct measurement of pancreatic fat and firmly
established the connection between fatty pancreas, obesity, high
triglycerides, and insulin resistance. Virtually all patients with fatty
pancreas also had fatty liver.
Most importantly, fatty pancreas is clearly associated with type 2
diabetes.30 Type 2 diabetic patients have more pancreatic and hepatic fat
than nondiabetics.31 The more fat found in the pancreas, the less insulin
it secretes.32 Simply put, fatty pancreas and fatty liver is the difference
between a type 2 diabetic and a nondiabetic.
The difference is obvious during bariatric (weight-loss) surgery, which
is used to reduce the size of the stomach or bypass the small intestine
(more on this in Chapter 13). This surgery does not directly remove fat,
like liposuction, which has no metabolic benefits.33 Obese nondiabetics
have a normal amount of pancreatic fat, which remains unchanged after
surgery despite the weight loss.
Obese type 2 diabetics have excess pancreatic fat, but bariatric
surgery reduces it and restores normal insulin-secreting ability. The result
is successful reversal of type 2 diabetes within weeks of their surgery,
even if they are still hundreds of kilograms overweight. The excess
pancreatic fat is only found in type 2 diabetics. The pancreatic beta cells
were clearly not burnt out; they were clogged with fat. The removal of
only 0.6 grams of pancreatic fat successfully reverses type 2 diabetes.
Eight weeks after bariatric surgery, liver fat also normalizes, as does
insulin resistance.
Bariatric surgery is not the only method of achieving these benefits.
Sudden severe caloric restriction in the COUNTERPOINT Study34 decreased
the amount of fat in the pancreas and re-established its ability to secrete
insulin within weeks.
Ectopic fat, the accumulation of fat in places other than fat cells, plays
a critical role in the development of insulin resistance. This includes fatty
liver, fatty muscle, and fatty pancreas. Even in severely obese patients,
insulin resistance does not develop in the absence of ectopic fat
accumulation.35 This fact explains how an estimated 20 percent of obese
individuals may have no insulin resistance and normal metabolic
profiles.36 Conversely, normal-weight subjects may develop type 2
diabetes if the fat is deposited in the organs instead of in the fat cells. Fat
inside fat cells is okay. Fat inside organs is not.
First noted in the 1950s,37 visceral obesity, also called central obesity
or abdominal obesity, is metabolically damaging. In the absence of
insulin, these ectopic fat deposits, and hence insulin resistance, cannot
develop.38 Indeed, accumulated fat deposits melt away under conditions
of sustained low insulin levels. Insulin is required to convert excess
calories to fat and also to sustain it as fat.
Developing type 2 diabetes is not simply a function of increased body
fat but the accumulation of intra-organic fat. The problem is not just the
fat, it’s the ectopic fat. Fatty liver and muscle drives the insulin resistance
seen in the first phase of development of type 2 diabetes. Fatty pancreas
drives the beta cell dysfunction seen in the second phase. The twin
defects of type 2 diabetes include
•
insulin resistance caused by fatty liver and fatty skeletal muscle, and
•
beta cell dysfunction caused by fatty pancreas.
Importantly, these two fundamental defects are not caused by two
completely different mechanisms. They are manifestations of the same
essential problem: intra-organic fat accumulation driven by
hyperinsulinemia, which is caused ultimately by excessive dietary
glucose and fructose. Essentially, too much sugar causes type 2
diabetes. This answer is the simplest, most intuitive, and most correct.
Ockham’s razor cuts through the confusion.
THE DUAL CYCLES: A SUMMARY
TWO VICIOUS CYCLES sustain type 2 diabetes: the hepatic and the
pancreatic. The hepatic cycle develops first. Excessive glucose and
fructose ingestion leads to hyperinsulinemia, fatty liver, and then insulin
resistance. The vicious cycle has begun. High insulin resistance further
stimulates hyperinsulinemia, perpetuating the cycle. This dance goes
around and around, gradually worsening each time.
Figure 7.4. The hepatic cycle (insulin resistance)
The hepatic cycle may continue for many years before the start of the
pancreatic cycle. The fatty liver decompresses itself by exporting newly
created fat as very low–density lipoprotein (VLDL) to other organs,
including the skeletal muscles and pancreas. As fatty muscle develops,
whole body insulin resistance worsens further. As the pancreas becomes
clogged with fat, it becomes unable to secrete insulin normally. Insulin
levels, previously high to offset the high blood glucose, begin to fall.
The loss of this compensation results in a rapid rise in blood glucose
and, ultimately, the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Even though insulin
drops, it stays maximally stimulated by the high blood glucose. This is the
body’s attempt to break this vicious cycle, as we shall soon discuss.
Figure 7.5. The pancreatic cycle (beta cell dysfunction)
The hepatic (insulin resistance) cycle and the pancreatic (beta cell
dysfunction) cycle together form the vicious twin cycles responsible for
the development of type 2 diabetes. But they have the same underlying
mechanism. Excessive insulin drives ectopic fat production and organ
infiltration. The underlying cause of the entire cascade of type 2 diabetes
is hyperinsulinemia. This is driven in turn by excessive dietary
consumption of sugar, primarily glucose and fructose. Simply put, type 2
diabetes is a disease entirely caused by too much sugar. To understand
fully, we need to consider the deadly effect of fructose.
THE FRUCTOSE–
INSULIN RESISTANCE
CONNECTION
IN 2009, DR. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, delivered a ninety-minute lecture entitled
“Sugar: The Bitter Truth.1 The university posted it on YouTube as part of
a medical education series. Then a funny thing happened. It went viral. It
was not a humorous cat video. It was not a video of a toddler throwing a
baseball into Dad’s groin. It was a nutrition lecture filled with biochemistry
and complicated graphs.
This particular lecture grabbed the world’s attention and refused to let
go. It has now been viewed more than seven million times. What was its
attention-grabbing message? Sugar is toxic.
Dr. Lustig was not the first physician to warn about the dangers of
eating too much sugar. In 1957, prominent British nutritionist Dr. John
Yudkin warned that sugar played a prominent role in the growing
incidence of heart disease. However, the world chose to follow Dr. Ancel
Keys’s condemnation of dietary fat instead. After leaving academic
medicine, Yudkin wrote an eerily prescient book entitled Pure, White and
Deadly,2 but his warnings have largely gone unheeded.
The 1977 Dietary Guidelines for Americans distinctly warned the
general public about the dangers of eating too much sugar, but this
message got lost in the anti-fat hysteria that followed. Dietary fat was
public enemy number one, and concerns about excess sugar faded like
the last rays of sunset. Sugar consumption rose steadily from 1977 to
2000, paralleled by rising obesity rates. Ten years later, type 2 diabetes
followed doggedly, like a bratty little brother.
Obesity alone does not fully explain the recent upsurge in diabetes.
Some countries with low obesity rates have high diabetes rates, while the
opposite is true, too.3 Sri Lanka’s obesity rates rose only 0.1 percent
between 2000 and 2010, while diabetes rose from 3 percent to 11
percent. Over the same time period, in New Zealand, obesity rose from
23 percent to 34 percent while diabetes fell from 8 percent to 5 percent.
Sugar consumption explains much of this discrepancy.
SUGAR BASICS
CARBOHYDRATES ARE SUGARS, either as single molecules (also called simple
sugars or monosaccharides) or as chains of sugars (also called complex
sugars or polysaccharides). Glucose and fructose are examples of
single-sugar carbohydrates. Table sugar, known as sucrose, is a two-
chain carbohydrate since it contains one molecule each of glucose and
fructose.
Naturally occurring carbohydrates are said to be unrefined, or
unprocessed. These include sugars found in fruit, vegetables, and raw
grains. Refined carbohydrates have been processed: for example, wheat
milled into flour; rice polished and hulled for easier steaming and boiling;
corn treated with acids and enzymes to turn it into syrup.
As we saw in chapter 5, glucose is the primary sugar found in the
blood. The terms blood sugar and blood glucose are used
interchangeably. Every cell in the body can use glucose, and it circulates
freely throughout the body. Muscle cells greedily import glucose from the
blood for a quick energy boost. Certain cells, such as red blood cells, can
only use glucose for energy.
Fructose is the sugar naturally found in fruit, and it is the sweetest-
tasting naturally occurring carbohydrate. Only the liver can metabolize
fructose, and this sugar does not circulate freely in the blood. The brain,
muscles, and other tissues cannot use fructose directly for energy. Eating
fructose does not appreciably change the body’s blood glucose level,
since they are different sugar molecules. Neither does fructose produce
much insulin response directly.
Sucrose is composed of one molecule of glucose linked to one
molecule of fructose, making it half glucose and half fructose. Chemically,
high-fructose corn syrup is similar to sucrose, being composed of 55
percent fructose and 45 percent glucose. Pure fructose is generally not
consumed directly, although it can be found as an ingredient in some
processed foods.
Starches, the main carbohydrates in potatoes, wheat, corn, and rice,
are long chains of glucose. Produced by plants, starches function as a
store of energy. Sometimes they grow underground, as in root
vegetables, and other times above ground, as in corn and wheat. By
weight, starches are approximately 70 percent amylopectin and 30
percent amylose (both are types of glucose chains). Animals, including
humans, chain glucose molecules together as glycogen instead of starch.
Once eaten, the chains of glucose in starches are broken down into
individual glucose molecules and absorbed into the intestines. Refined
carbohydrates, such as flour, are quickly digested, whereas unprocessed
carbohydrates, such as beans, take much longer. As explained in chapter
4, the glycemic index reflects how much various carbohydrates raise
blood glucose. Pure glucose causes the largest rise in blood glucose and
is therefore given the maximal reference value of 100. All other foods are
measured against this yardstick.
Other dietary sugars, like fructose or lactose (the sugar found in milk),
do not raise blood glucose levels appreciably and therefore have
correspondingly low glycemic index values. Since sucrose is half glucose
and half fructose, it has an intermediate glycemic index. Only the glucose
portion of sucrose raises blood glucose appreciably.
Fructose, which raises neither blood glucose nor insulin, was
considered more benign than other sweeteners for many years. An all-
natural sweetener found in fruit that didn’t raise the glycemic index sure
sounded healthy. But it had a hidden dark side that was not obvious for
many decades. The toxicity of fructose was invisible when looking at the
blood glucose; it only became apparent by looking at the slow
accumulation of fat in the liver.
THE DOSE MAKES THE POISON
PARACELSUS (1493–1541), a Swiss-German physician who is considered
the founder of modern toxicology, neatly summarized one of its most
basic principles as “the dose makes the poison.” That is, anything can be
harmful in excessive amounts, even if it is typically considered beneficial.
Oxygen can be toxic at high levels. Water, too, can be toxic at high
levels. Fructose is no different.
Before the year 1900, the average person consumed 15 to 20 grams
of fructose per day. All of it would have come from raw fruit, which
contributes little fructose to our diet. An apple, for example, contains 7.6
grams of sugar per 100 grams; a grapefruit, just 1.2 grams. By World War
II, sugar cane and sugar beets were farmed on large plantations, which
made sucrose, the sugar processed from these plants, cheaper and more
available than it had ever been. Yearly per capita consumption of fructose
rose to 24 grams per day after the war and reached 37 grams per day by
1977.
In the 1960s, the development of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a
liquid-sugar equivalent of sucrose, became a game-changer. Processed
from the river of cheap corn flowing out of the American Midwest, HFCS
was much less expensive to produce than other forms of sugar. To
increase profits, big food companies raced to replace sucrose with this
cheaper substitute. Soon HFCS had found its way into almost every
processed food imaginable: pizza sauces, soups, breads, cookies, cakes,
ketchup, spreads.
Fructose intake skyrocketed. By 1994, the average person consumed
55 grams per day, or 10 percent of their calories. Fructose consumption
finally peaked in the year 2000, by which time it had increased fivefold
within the space of 100 years. Adolescents, in particular, were eating as
much as 25 percent of their calories as added sugars, at 72.8 grams per
day. Between the late 1970s and 2006, the per capita intake of sugar-
sweetened beverages almost doubled to 141.7 kcal per day. Countries
that use large amounts of HFCS have suffered a 20 percent increase in
the prevalence of diabetes compared to those that do not. The United
States, by the way, is the undisputed heavyweight champion of HFCS, with
a per capita consumption of almost 55 pounds.4 The dose makes the
poison.
FRUCTOSE AND FATTY LIVER
FRUCTOSE IS EVEN more strongly linked to obesity and diabetes than
glucose is. From a nutritional standpoint, neither fructose nor glucose
contains essential nutrients. As a sweetener, both are similar. Yet
fructose is particularly malevolent to human health compared to glucose
due to the unique way the body metabolizes it.
Whereas every cell in the body can use glucose for energy, none can
use fructose. Only the liver metabolizes fructose. Whereas excess
glucose can be dispersed throughout the body for use as energy,
fructose targets the liver like a guided missile.
When we eat large quantities of glucose, such as starches, these
sugars circulate to every cell, helping disperse the load. Cells other than
the liver metabolize 80 percent of the ingested glucose. At mealtimes, the
heart, lungs, muscles, brain, and kidneys help themselves to this all-you-
can-eat glucose buffet, leaving only 20 percent of it for the liver to mop
up5 and convert into glycogen for storage.
When we eat large quantities of fructose, on the other hand, it heads
straight to the liver, since no other cells can use or metabolize it.
Consider what this means for an average person weighing 170 pounds.
Sucrose provides equal amounts of glucose and fructose. Whereas all
170 pounds of the body metabolize the glucose, the 5-pound liver must
valiantly metabolize the equivalent amount of fructose all on its own.
Moreover, the liver metabolizes fructose into glucose, lactose, and
glycogen without limitations, so the more you eat, the more you
metabolize. And because the refining process removes the protein, fiber,
and fat naturally found in carbohydrates, the satiating effect of these
constituents is lost. For example, 1000 calories of baked potato will make
you quite full, but the same 1000 calories of sugary cola will not, despite
that fact that both are mostly carbohydrate. However, one is unprocessed
and the other is highly processed.
As a result, we digest refined carbohydrates such as HFCS faster, and
because we don’t feel full, we eat more of them and our blood glucose
increases. When the limited glycogen stores are full, DNL changes the
excess fructose directly into liver fat.
Fructose overfeeding can increase DNL fivefold,6 and replacing
glucose with a calorically equal amount of fructose increases liver fat by a
massive 38 percent within only eight days. This fatty liver plays a crucial
role in the development of insulin resistance. Fructose’s propensity to
cause fatty liver is unique among carbohydrates. Furthermore, this
harmful effect of fructose does not require high blood glucose or blood
insulin levels to wreak its havoc. Fructose functions as efficiently as a
bullet train in causing fatty liver disease, which is only a short step away
from insulin resistance.
Since fatty liver and the resultant insulin resistance is a key
contributor to hyperinsulinemia and obesity, this means that fructose is
far more dangerous than glucose. A back-of-the-envelope calculation
shows that, for an average 170-pound person, fructose would be
approximately 34 times (170 divided by 5) more likely to cause fatty liver
and thus obesity and insulin resistance.
The way the body metabolizes ethanol (alcohol) is quite similar. Once
ingested, tissues can only metabolize 20 percent of the alcohol, leaving
80 percent targeted straight to the liver.7 The liver metabolizes it to
acetaldehyde, which stimulates de novo lipogenesis, so alcohol, like
fructose, easily becomes liver fat.8 This explains the well-known effect of
alcohol consumption in producing fatty liver disease.
Figure 8.1. Hormonal obesity V: Fructose, fatty liver, and insulin resistance
FRUCTOSE AND INSULIN RESISTANCE
THAT FRUCTOSE OVERFEEDING could experimentally provoke insulin
resistance has been known since as far back as 1980. Healthy subjects
overfed 1000 calories per day of fructose showed a 25 percent worsening
of their insulin sensitivity after just seven days. Glucose overfeeding of
subjects, by contrast, did not show any similar deterioration.9
A more recent study (2009) reinforced how easily fructose induces
insulin resistance in healthy volunteers.10 Subjects consumed 25 percent
of their daily calories as Kool-Aid sweetened with either glucose or
fructose. While this amount seems extreme, many people do consume
this high a proportion of sugar in their diets. The fructose group—but not
the glucose group—increased their insulin resistance so much that they
would be clinically classified as prediabetics, a development that required
only eight weeks of fructose overconsumption.
Remarkably, it only takes one week of excess fructose to cause
insulin resistance. It only takes eight weeks to allow prediabetes to
establish a beachhead. What happens after decades of high fructose
consumption? The result is a diabetes disaster—precisely the one we are
experiencing right now.
FRUCTOSE AND THE GLOBAL DIABETES EPIDEMIC
DATA FROM MORE than 175 nations links sugar intake inextricably to
diabetes, independent of obesity. For example, Asian sugar consumption
is rising at almost 5 percent per year, even as it has stabilized or fallen in
North America. The result has been a tsunami of diabetes. In 2013, an
estimated 11.6 percent of Chinese adults had type 2 diabetes.11 Yet the
Chinese being diagnosed with diabetes have an average body mass
index of only 23.7, which is considered in the ideal range. By contrast,
American diabetics average a body mass index of 28.7, well within the
overweight category.
Consider that in 1980 only 1 percent of Chinese had type 2 diabetes.
This situation presents an apparent paradox since the Chinese diet has
traditionally been based upon white rice. Yet, despite such a high intake
of refined carbohydrates, the Chinese have suffered little obesity or type
2 diabetes. The reason for this apparent protection is that they ate almost
no sugar, as Figure 8.2 shows. Refined carbohydrates, such as white
rice, are composed of long chains of glucose, whereas table sugar
contains equal parts of glucose and fructose.
In the late 1990s, the INTERMAP study compared the diets of the U.K.,
U.S., Japan, and China.12 Chinese sugar consumption has steadily
increased since the time of that study, and diabetes rates have moved in
lockstep. Combined with their original high-carbohydrate intake, the
Chinese are facing their current diabetes disaster.
Figure 8.2. The traditional Chinese diet: High carbs, low sugar, no diabetes13
To a lesser extent, the same story has played out in the United States.
Americans gradually switched from consuming their carbohydrates as
grains to eating them as sugar in the form of corn syrup.14 Consider
Figure 8.3; when both grain and fructose intake began to rise in the late
1970s, the result was the start of an epidemic of obesity and type 2
diabetes.
Sugar is more fattening than any other refined carbohydrate, and
leads specifically to type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes climbs
1.1 percent for every extra 150 sugar calories per person per day.15 Each
additional daily 12-oz serving of soda increases the risk of diabetes by 25
percent and the risk of metabolic syndrome by 20 percent.16 No other
food group—not dietary fat, not protein—shows any significant
relationship to diabetes.
Diabetes correlates strongly to sugar, not other sources of calories.
Fructose overconsumption directly stimulates fatty liver and leads directly
to insulin resistance. Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, which is
chemically almost identical to sugar, also shows the same tight
correlation to diabetes.17
Figure 8.3. Replacement of whole grain carbs with HFCS in the U.S.18
There is something sinister about overconsumption of fructose. What
distinguishes sugar from other highly refined carbohydrates? What is the
common link to disease? Fructose. Yes, Dr. Robert Lustig had it right.
The dose makes the poison—and in the doses we are currently eating it,
sugar is a toxin.
FRUCTOSE TOXICITY
FRUCTOSE IS PARTICULARLY toxic for several reasons. First, as we’ve seen,
only the liver can metabolize it, so virtually all ingested fructose is stored
as newly created fat. This excessive liver fat directly causes insulin
resistance.
Second, the liver metabolizes fructose without limits. More ingested
fructose leads to more hepatic DNL and more liver fat, independent of
insulin. Fructose does little to activate natural satiety pathways that limit
food intake, and no natural brakes exist to slow down the overproduction
of new fat. This explains why you can still eat sweet desserts even after a
full meal.
Third, fructose has no alternative runoff pathway. The liver stores
excess glucose safely and easily as glycogen, breaking it back down into
glucose when the body needs access to energy. On the other hand, the
body cannot store fructose directly. When the body has enough energy to
meet its actual needs, the liver metabolizes fructose into fat through a
process that cannot be easily reversed. Therefore, the body can handle
only small amounts of fructose. Remember, the dose makes the poison.
But this toxicity is not easily recognized. In the short term, fructose
has few obvious health risks since it affects neither blood glucose nor
insulin levels. Instead, it exerts its toxicity mainly through long-term
effects on fatty liver and insulin resistance, which may take decades to
manifest. Short-term studies, often focusing on insulin, blood glucose,
and calories, miss this long-term effect, just as short-term studies of
cigarette smoking miss the long-term cancer risk.
So sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup, both of which are roughly
equal parts glucose and fructose, play a dual role in obesity and type 2
diabetes. More than simply empty calories, glucose is a refined
carbohydrate that stimulates insulin production and, when consumed in
large amounts, leads to fatty liver.
Overconsuming fructose, on the other hand, produces fatty liver and
insulin resistance directly, without noticeably disturbing blood glucose or
insulin. Fructose is many times more likely than glucose to cause fatty
liver, setting off a vicious cycle. Insulin resistance leads to
hyperinsulinemia, leading back to more insulin resistance.
Sugar, as both glucose and fructose, therefore stimulates insulin
production in both the short term and the long term. In this way, sucrose
is far more menacing than starches that contain only glucose, such as
the amylopectin in flour. However, while the glycemic index makes the
effect of glucose obvious, the effect of fructose is completely hidden,
which has long led scientists to downplay the role of sugar in obesity.
A seemingly obvious solution is to replace fructose in the diet with
artificial sweeteners. While the biochemistry of these compounds is far
beyond the scope of this book, these agents are not a satisfactory
solution to the fructose overload. The proof of the pudding is in the
eating: we have used large and increasing amounts of these sweeteners
in our diets and diabetes has not gone away. So we can debate why
artificial sweeteners should work, but the bottom line is that they do not.
So when Dr. Lustig stepped onto that lonely stage in 2009 and
declared that sugar was toxic, the world listened with rapt attention. This
professor of endocrinology was telling us something we already,
instinctively, knew to be true despite all the platitudes and the
reassurances that sugar was not a problem: in sufficiently large amounts,
sugar in any form is a toxin. The dose makes the poison.
THE METABOLIC SYNDROME
CONNECTION
THE IDENTIFICATION OF metabolic syndrome (MetS), originally termed
Syndrome X, is one of the great medical advances of the past thirty
years. The 2005 National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult
Treatment Program III (ATP III) defines metabolic syndrome as three of the
following five conditions1:
1. Abdominal obesity, measured by waist circumference: men over 40
inches, women over 35 inches;
2. Low high-density lipoprotein (HDL): men less than 40 mg/dL or women
less than 50 mg/dL or taking medication;
3. High triglycerides: over 150 mg/dL or taking medication;
4. High blood pressure: over 130 mmHg systolic (top number) or over
85 mmHg diastolic (bottom number) or taking medication;
5. Fasting blood glucose > 100 mg/dL or taking medication.
Metabolic syndrome affects almost one-third of the adult population of
North America2 and this linked group of problems increases the risk of
heart disease by almost 300 percent. Metabolic syndrome also increases
the risk of stroke, cancer, NASH, PCOS, and obstructive sleep apnea. Even
more worrisome, MetS is increasingly being diagnosed in our children.3
So what does metabolic syndrome have to do with diabetes? A lot, as
it turns out.
UNDERSTANDING METABOLIC SYNDROME
IN 1988, Dr. Gerald Reaven of Stanford University introduced the concept
of a single syndrome in his Banting Medal address, one of the highest-
profile academic lectures in all of diabetic medicine.4 He called it
Syndrome X to denote a single variable—then unknown—that caused
this constellation of problems. But what was this X factor?
Our understanding of metabolic syndrome began in the 1950s, when
researchers showed a close association between high levels of
triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. To their surprise,
hypertriglyceridemia was not caused by eating too much fat; instead, it
resulted primarily from excess dietary carbohydrates and the subsequent
hyperinsulinemia.5
Around the same time, early insulin assays confirmed that many
people with relatively minor blood glucose elevations had severe
hyperinsulinemia. This was understood as a compensatory mechanism in
response to elevated insulin resistance. In 1963, Dr. Reaven observed
that patients with heart attacks often had both high triglycerides and
hyperinsulinemia,6 firmly linking these two diseases.
Researchers noted a link between high blood pressure (hypertension)
and hyperinsulinemia as early as 1966.7 By 1985, research showed that
much of essential hypertension, so called because the underlying cause
remained unidentified, was also closely associated with high insulin
levels.8
Remember that metabolic syndrome identifies patients with a shared
group of risk factors that all have a common origin. High blood glucose,
resulting from increased insulin resistance, central obesity, high blood
pressure, and abnormal lipids all reflect a single underlying problem.9
And each additional component of metabolic syndrome increases the risk
of future cardiovascular disease. In fact, the major diseases of the
twenty-first century—heart disease, cancer, diabetes—have all been
related to metabolic syndrome and its common cause, the X factor. That
X factor, as it turns out, is hyperinsulinemia.10
It is worth noting that while obesity, as defined by BMI, is commonly
associated with metabolic syndrome, MetS can also be found in
approximately 25 percent of non-obese individuals with normal glucose
tolerance levels. This emphasizes again that the problem is not obesity
per se, but abdominal obesity. Similarly, high levels of low-density
lipoprotein (LDL, or “bad” cholesterol) are pointedly not one of the criteria
for developing metabolic syndrome. Despite the current obsession with
lowering LDL cholesterol with statin medications, high LDL is not a
component of the metabolic syndrome and may not have the same
origins.
Recent research has supported and extended this concept of a single
syndrome with a common cause. Let’s see how this all develops.
FROM FATTY LIVER TO METABOLIC SYNDROME
AS WE’VE SEEN previously, the liver lies at the nexus of metabolism and
nutrient flow, particularly for carbohydrates and proteins. Situated
immediately downstream from the intestines, nutrients enter the blood in
the portal circulation and pass directly to the liver. The major exception is
dietary fat, which is absorbed directly into the lymphatic system as
chylomicrons. These chylomicrons empty into the bloodstream without
first passing through the liver.
As the major organ responsible for storing and distributing energy, the
liver is naturally the main site of action of the hormone insulin. When
carbohydrates and proteins are absorbed, the pancreas releases insulin.
It travels in the portal vein, an expressway to the liver. Concentrations of
glucose and insulin are often ten times higher in the blood of the portal
system and liver than in the rest of the body.
Insulin promotes the storage of food energy for later use, a
mechanism that has allowed us to survive the periods of famine inherent
in human history. The liver prefers to store extra glucose in long glycogen
chains since it is an easily accessible form of energy. However, there is
limited space inside the liver for that glycogen. Think of a refrigerator. We
can easily place food (glucose) into the refrigerator (glycogen) and take it
out again. Once the glycogen stores are full, the liver must find a different
storage form for the excess glucose. It transforms this glucose through
de novo lipogenesis (DNL) into newly created molecules of triglycerides,
also known as body fat.
Hypertriglyceridemia
THESE NEWLY CREATED triglycerides are made from the substrate glucose,
not from dietary fat. This distinction is important because fats made by
DNL are highly saturated. Eating dietary carbohydrates, not dietary
saturated fat, increases saturated fat levels in the blood. Saturated fats in
the blood, not the diet, are highly associated with heart disease.
When needed, the triglyceride molecule from body fat can be broken
into three fatty acids, which most organs use directly for energy. The
process of converting this fat to energy and back again is far more
cumbersome than using glycogen. However, fat storage provides the
unique advantage of unlimited storage space. Think of a chest freezer in
your basement. Although it is more difficult to move food (triglycerides)
into and out of your freezer (adipocytes, or fat cells), primarily because
you have to move it farther, the size of the freezer allows you to store
larger amounts. The basement also has enough space for a second or
third freezer, if needed.
These two forms of storage fulfill different and complementary roles.
The stored glucose, or glycogen (fridge), is easily accessible but limited
in capacity. The stored body fat, or triglycerides (freezer), are hard to
access but unlimited in capacity.
The two main activators of DNL are insulin and excessive dietary
fructose. High dietary intake of carbohydrates—and to a lesser extent,
protein—stimulates insulin secretion and provides the substrate for DNL.
With DNL running at full production, large amounts of new fat are created.
Excessive DNL can overwhelm the export mechanism, resulting in
abnormal retention of this new fat in the liver.11 As you stuff more and
more fat into the liver, it becomes noticeably engorged and can be
diagnosed on ultrasound as fatty liver. But if the liver is not the
appropriate place to store this new fat, where should it go?
First, you could try to burn it off for energy. However, with all the
available glucose around after a meal, the body has no reason to burn
the new fat. Imagine you have gone to Costco and bought waaayyy too
much food to store in your refrigerator. One option is to eat it, but there’s
simply too much. If you cannot get rid of it, much of the food will be left on
the counter where it will rot. So this option is not viable.
Your glycogen “fridge” is full, so the only remaining option is to export
the newly created fat (excess food) somewhere else. This mechanism is
known as the endogenous pathway of lipid transport. Essentially,
triglycerides are packaged with special proteins to create very low–
density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are released into the bloodstream to
help decompress the congested liver.12
More dietary glucose and fructose means more DNL which means
more VLDL must be released.13, 14 This mass export of triglyceride-rich
VLDL particles is the major reason for high plasma triglyceride levels,15
which are detectable in all standard blood tests for cholesterol. Ultimately,
eating too much glucose and too much fructose causes this
hypertriglyceridemia.
Figure 9.1. Hormonal obesity VI: The effect of high triglycerides
High-carbohydrate diets increase VLDL secretion and raise blood
triglyceride levels by 30 to 40 percent.16 Called carbohydrate-induced
hypertriglyceridemia, this phenomenon can occur with as little as five
days of high intake. Dr. Reaven showed that hyperinsulinemia and
fructose shared responsibility for most of the rise in blood triglyceride
levels.17 Simply put, higher insulin levels and fructose ingestion produce
higher blood triglyceride levels. There’s just too much sugar.
Low high-density lipoproteins (HDL)
AS VLDL PARTICLES circulate through the bloodstream, insulin stimulates the
hormone lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is found in the small blood vessels
of muscles, adipocytes, and the heart. This LPL transports the
triglycerides out of the blood into adipocytes for safe storage.
As VLDL releases its triglycerides, the particles become smaller and
denser; now called VLDL remnants, the liver reabsorbs them. In turn, the
liver releases these remnants back into the bloodstream as low-density
lipoproteins (LDL), which are measured by standard blood cholesterol
panels and are classically considered the “bad” cholesterol.
High blood triglycerides strongly and independently predict
cardiovascular disease,18 almost as powerfully as LDL, the marker that
typically concerns doctors and patients most. Hypertriglyceridemia
increases the risk of heart disease by as much as 61 percent,19 and the
average triglyceride level has been rising inexorably in the United States
since 1976. An estimated 31 percent of adult Americans have elevated
triglyceride levels,20 though hypertriglyceridemia by itself is unlikely to
cause heart disease since medications that lower triglycerides do not
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.21
High levels of LDL are pointedly not one of the criteria for developing
metabolic syndrome. Instead, the other cholesterol component of the
metabolic syndrome is the high-density lipoproteins (HDL, the “good”
cholesterol). The landmark Framingham studies established that low
levels of HDL are strongly associated with heart disease22 and predicts
heart disease much more powerfully than LDL.
Low levels of HDL are found in close association with high levels of
triglycerides: more than 50 percent of patients with low HDL also have
high triglycerides. High levels of triglycerides activate the enzyme
cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), which reduces HDL levels. Given
this close association with triglycerides, it should be no surprise that low-
carbohydrate diets raise HDL,23 even independent of weight loss. As with
triglycerides, low HDL does not cause heart disease, but is a powerful
indicator.24
What is clear, however, is that the lipid profile typical of the metabolic
syndrome—high triglycerides and low HDL—results from the excess of
VLDL,25 which ultimately stems from hyperinsulinemia, which ultimately
stems from eating too much glucose and fructose. Again, too much
sugar.
Figure 9.2. Hormonal obesity VII: Fatty liver → low HDL
Abdominal obesity
THE ADIPOCYTES GET larger as they take up the triglycerides for storage.
This is not particularly dangerous to our health since adipocytes are
designed to store fat. But being too fat is dangerous from an evolutionary
standpoint, because fat animals get eaten.
The adipocytes protect themselves against overexpansion by
releasing the hormone leptin. This signals the hypothalamic area of the
brain that we need to lose fat. We stop eating, insulin drops, and we lose
weight. In this way, obesity serves as the first line of defense against
hyperinsulinemia.
Insulin encourages fat storage, whereas leptin strives to reduce it. If
leptin proves more powerful, then weight is lost and fat mass decreases.
This negative feedback loop should keep us at an ideal weight. So how
do we become obese? This problem occurs when insulin stays too high
for too long, which is typical in insulin resistance.
If you have too much body fat, leptin is released, which decreases
food intake. Insulin should fall, and you should lose weight. In insulin-
resistant states, insulin levels stay persistently high, which tells the body
to keep storing fat. Leptin therefore stays persistently high too. As with all
hormones, exposure creates resistance, so persistently high leptin
creates the leptin resistance found in common obesity. It’s a tug of war
between insulin and leptin, and if you are eating too much sugar,
ultimately, insulin wins.
Insulin allows glucose to move from the blood into the cells. Persistent
hyperinsulinemia crams even more glucose into the liver, creating even
more new fat. When hyperinsulinemia persists, the pedal-to-the-metal
production of new fat overwhelms the adipocytes. Fat backs up, causing
fatty liver. Fructose is directly converted to liver fat and leads to the next
stage, insulin resistance.
If allowed to continue, the engorged liver will become distended and
injured. The liver cell cannot safely handle any more glucose, yet insulin
is still pushing really, really hard to shove more inside. The liver’s only
option is to refuse entry. This is known as insulin resistance, and it
develops as the body’s second line of defense against hyperinsulinemia.
The liver feverishly tries to relieve the fatty congestion by exporting
triglycerides, and blood levels increase in a classic sign of metabolic
syndrome. Ectopic fat accumulates in other organs, such as the
pancreas, kidneys, heart, and muscle. The predominance of fat around
the abdomen becomes noticeable as an increase in waist size, which can
be described as a beer belly but more recently is being called a “wheat
belly.” This abdominal, or visceral, fat is the most important predictor of
metabolic syndrome.26 Surgical removal of visceral fat reverses insulin
resistance,27 whereas removal of subcutaneous fat has no such
metabolic benefits.28
High blood glucose
IN ADDITION TO accumulating in the abdominal region, fat accumulates
within organs that are not designed to store it. Distention of the liver and
skeletal muscles with fat increases insulin resistance, even though the
pancreas increases insulin to keep blood glucose levels relatively normal.
But that’s not the end of the story.
Ectopic fat clogs the pancreas and interferes with normal functioning,
so insulin levels fall. When the fatty pancreas fails to produce the
compensatory hyperinsulinemia, blood glucose skyrockets and becomes
symptomatic when it exceeds the renal threshold. Glucose spills out into
the urine, and the classic symptoms of diabetes—excessive urination,
thirst, and weight loss—appear.
High blood pressure (hypertension)
HIGH BLOOD PRESURE is often called “the silent killer” because there are no
symptoms, yet it contributes heavily to the development of heart attacks
and strokes. Most cases are called essential hypertension because no
specific cause can be found for its development; however,
hyperinsulinemia plays a key role.
Researchers first reported disproportionately high blood insulin
concentration in hypertensive patients more than fifty years ago.29 Since
then, multiple studies, such as the European Group Study of Insulin
Resistance,30 have confirmed this relationship. High and rising insulin
levels doubled the risk of developing hypertension in those who
previously had normal blood pressure.31 A complete review of all
available studies estimates that hyperinsulinemia increases the risk of
hypertension by 63 percent.32
Insulin increases blood pressure through multiple mechanisms.33
Insulin increases the cardiac output—the contractile force of the heart34
—and the volume of blood in circulation by enhancing the kidney’s ability
to reabsorb sodium (salt). In addition, insulin stimulates the secretion of
anti-diuretic hormone, which helps the body to reabsorb water. Together,
this salt and water retention mechanism increases blood volume and thus
causes higher blood pressure. Insulin also constricts blood vessels,
increasing the pressure inside.35
Figure 9.3. Hormonal obesity VIII: Hyperinsulinemia and hypertension
WHY METABOLIC SYNDROME MATTERS
EACH ADDITIONAL COMPONENT of metabolic syndrome—high triglycerides,
low HDL, central obesity, high blood glucose, and high blood pressure—
significantly increases the risk of all the modern metabolic diseases, such
as heart attacks, strokes, peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes,
Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. These symptoms cluster together, but
not every disease manifests in every person: one person may have low
triglycerides, another person will have high blood sugars from insulin
resistance, and yet another will have high blood pressure. But having one
of these factors increases the likelihood of having the others because
they all share the same root cause.
In a typical patient, gaining as little as 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of
weight is the first detectable abnormality related to
hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance, followed by low HDL cholesterol
levels. High blood pressure, fatty liver, and high triglycerides emerge
next, at roughly the same time. The very last symptom to appear is
usually high blood glucose, which clinches the diagnosis of type 2
diabetes.
The West of Scotland study36 confirmed that fatty liver and elevated
triglycerides precede the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Fatty liver occurs
early in metabolic syndrome. While virtually all patients with metabolic
syndrome have fatty liver, the opposite is not true. Only a minority of
patients with fatty liver have full-blown metabolic syndrome (see Figure
9.4).
Figure 9.4. Hormonal obesity IX: Full-blown metabolic syndrome
Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes cannot cause metabolic
syndrome because they are part of the syndrome. Hyperinsulinemia
causes it. The very core of the problem is hyperinsulinemia from
excessive fructose and glucose, but especially fructose intake. Metabolic
syndrome, of which obesity and type 2 diabetes are a key part, are
ultimately caused by—you guessed it—too much sugar.
Obesity, insulin resistance, and beta cell dysfunction are all protective
mechanisms. Obesity tries to prevent DNL from overwhelming the liver by
safely storing the newly created fat in the adipocytes. We know this
because patients with a rare, genetic disorder called lipodystrophy, which
is characterized by a lack of fat cells,37 show all the manifestations of
metabolic syndrome—fatty liver, elevated triglycerides, and extremely
high levels of insulin resistance—without the weight gain. In rodent
models of lipodystrophy, transplanting adipocytes back into these fat-free
mice completely cures metabolic syndrome.
Fat cells actually provide protection against metabolic syndrome
rather than causing it. Why? Because without adipocytes, fat must be
stored inside the organs, where it causes metabolic syndrome. If fat can
be stored inside adipocytes instead, no metabolic damage results.
Obesity is the first line of defense against the root problem of
hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance.
Similarly, insulin resistance is the body’s attempt to prevent fat from
amassing in the internal organs by preventing it from entering. The liver
refuses to allow more glucose to enter because it is already overfilled,
and the result is visible as insulin resistance, which represents a second
protective mechanism.
The final line of defense lies in shutting down pancreatic production of
insulin. Blood glucose rapidly rises above the renal threshold and causes
all the classic symptoms of diabetes. But this toxic load of glucose has
been safely discharged out of the body, and is unable to cause further
metabolic damage. The core problems of too much glucose and insulin
have been handled, but at the cost of symptomatic diabetes. The
essential problem is too much sugar, and the body is desperately
dumping it out in the urine.
All the conditions we thought were problems—obesity, insulin
resistance, and beta cell dysfunction—are actually the body’s solutions to
a single root cause—too much sugar. And when we understand the root
cause, the answer to all of these problems—and to type 2 diabetes—
becomes immediately obvious. We need to get rid of the sugar and lower
insulin.
If we fail to remove the problems of too much sugar, too much insulin,
and ectopic fat, then the problem is chronic and progressive. When we
treat the root cause, then type 2 diabetes, and indeed the entire
metabolic syndrome, is a completely reversible disease.
BRUNO
Bruno, 75, had a thirty-year history of type 2 diabetes, which
caused some eye and nerve damage as well as chronic kidney
disease. He also suffered from gout, peripheral vascular
disease, and high blood pressure. When we first met four years
ago, he weighed 215 pounds and used 68 units of insulin daily.
Once he began the IDM program, Bruno started on a low-
carbohydrate, healthy-fat diet with 36-hour fasts every other
day. Within four weeks, he was able to stop taking insulin
completely and has not required any since. This result still
astounds him because he had been using insulin for over
twenty years. In addition, he no longer needs any medication
for blood pressure or cholesterol. His latest A1C is only 6.1%,
which classifies him as prediabetic rather than diabetic.
Bruno adjusted quickly to his new diet and fasting regimen
and finds it simple to follow, even several years later. He has
maintained a 48-pound weight loss and a 24 cm reduction in
waist size over these last four years.
RAVI
Ravi, now 40, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when he
was only 28 years old. After starting on blood-glucose-lowering
medications, he required higher and higher doses until he was
finally prescribed insulin, which he was told he would need for
life. In addition, he had developed high cholesterol and
hypertension. He was taking 102 units of insulin daily, in
addition to canagliflozin and metformin. Yet despite these huge
doses of medication, his A1C was still 10.8%, which indicates
that his blood glucose was completely out of control.
When Ravi entered the IDM program, he switched to a low-
carbohydrate, healthy-fat diet and started fasting three times a
week for 36 hours each time. Within two weeks, he was able to
stop taking any insulin, and his blood glucose numbers were
better than ever. Within two months, when his cholesterol and
blood pressure had returned to normal, he stopped taking
metformin and his doctor lowered his cholesterol and blood
pressure medications to a quarter of their previous doses. In
addition, he lost 23 pounds and his waist circumference
decreased by 18 cm. Now, ten months into the program, he
continues to take a single (non-insulin) medication, but his A1C
is 7.4% and continues to improve.
INSULIN:
NOT THE ANSWER FOR
TYPE 2 DIABETES
THE CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes has long
been injection of exogenous (external) insulin. Human insulin, one of the
great triumphs of modern pharmaceutical science, can be produced in a
laboratory and packaged for convenient injection. For most of the early
and mid-twentieth century, research focused on type 1 diabetes, which is
caused by a severe lack of insulin. Without exogenous insulin
replacement, cells cannot use glucose and they starve, leading to
unrelenting weight loss and eventual death. This formerly fatal disease
has become manageable, but injecting insulin comes with its own
complications.
It is essential to match the insulin dose with the amount of food being
eaten, especially carbohydrates, since complications arise when blood
glucose goes too far outside the normal range. Underdosing causes high
blood glucose (hyperglycemia) and overdosing causes low blood glucose
(hypoglycemia). Mild hypoglycemic reactions cause patients to sweat and
shake, but more severe reactions can include seizures, loss of
consciousness, and death. In 2014, nearly 100,000 emergency room
visits and 30,000 admissions to hospital were directly related to
hypoglycemia.1
Extremely high blood glucose can cause diabetic ketoacidosis in type
1 diabetes and non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma in type 2 diabetes, but
these complications are relatively uncommon. On the other hand, until
the early 1990s it was unclear whether mildly elevated blood glucose was
even all that dangerous. So for many decades, the standard medical
practice was to keep the blood glucose levels slightly high, but below 10
mmol/L, the renal threshold for glucose. At this level, the kidneys
completely reabsorb glucose so that none spills over into the urine,
thereby avoiding the typical diabetic symptoms of excessive urination and
thirst. And keeping the levels slightly above normal avoids both
hypoglycemia and the symptoms of high blood glucose. In the past, this
was considered an acceptable trade-off, as nobody had yet found
definitive proof that this level was harmful. This point of view changed
irrevocably in 1993.
INSULIN AND GLUCOTOXICITY
THE DIABETES CONTROL and Complications Trial (DCCT)2—a large,
randomized, controlled trial of patients with type 1 diabetes carried out
between 1983 and 1993—proved that intensive insulin therapy, including
tight management of blood glucose levels, could have dramatic beneficial
results. Close monitoring and multiple daily insulin injections to keep
blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible could prevent the
end-organ damage associated with hyperglycemia: diabetic eye disease
decreased by 76 percent, kidney disease by 50 percent, and nerve
damage by 60 percent.
In 2005, researchers published a follow-up study called the
Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC).3 They
followed more than 90 percent of the original DCCT patients for up to
seventeen years, and found that the intensive insulin treatment had
reduced cardiovascular disease by an astonishing 42 percent. These two
studies clearly established the paradigm of glucotoxicity—that high blood
glucose is toxic in type 1 diabetes.
Figure 10.1. Intensive insulin therapy leads to major weight gain4
Some patients, however, paid a price. Hypoglycemic episodes during
the DCCT study were three times more common in the intensive insulin
group compared to those receiving standard treatment. Other patients
experienced major weight gain. Over nine years, almost 30 percent of the
subjects in that group gained a significant amount of weight, defined as
an increase in body mass index of more than 5. This far exceeded the
impact on those receiving conventional insulin therapy. One-quarter of
that intensive treatment group had increased their body mass index from
24 (normal weight) to 31 (obese). Given the health consequences of
obesity, this was no small concern. Other disquieting danger signs
appeared, too. The weight gain was concentrated in the abdominal area,
the central obesity known to be far more predictive of future
cardiovascular disease. Other key risk factors, blood pressure and blood
cholesterol, also increased.
Over time, weight, waist circumference, and insulin dosage continued
to grow inexorably. Intensive insulin treatment had led to metabolic
syndrome. Type 1 diabetic patients with the most weight gain also
developed the highest coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid
intimal medial thickness (CIMT) scores;5 their high insulin dosage reliably
predicted these measures of advanced atherosclerosis.6 Heavy-handed
dosing of insulin to reduce blood glucose had produced all the problems
of excessive insulin: obesity, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis.
Despite these side effects, intensive insulin dosing was worth the risk for
the proven cardiovascular benefits, but only for type 1 diabetes.
However, this glucotoxicity paradigm—the idea that elevated blood
glucose was the primary cause of end-organ damage—was accepted for
both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The paradigm had not yet been proven
for type 2 diabetes, but it seemed only a matter of time. The logical
treatment was to give enough insulin or other medication to keep blood
glucose normal. Even today, most doctors cling to this unproven
treatment for type 2 diabetes like chewing gum clings to a boot sole.
Does it work?
GLUCOTOXICITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES
THE LANDMARK DCCT trial had established the paradigm of glucotoxicity in
type 1 diabetes. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study
(UKPDS), started in the 1970s, was expected to prove the benefits of
intensive blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes.7 Researchers set out
to determine two things about treatment: first, whether intensive glucose
control could reduce complications, and second, whether there were
differences among the different medications. The study randomly
assigned almost 4000 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients to either
conventional or intensive treatments, using the available medications of
the time: insulin, sulfonylureas (SUs), and metformin.
Published in 1998, the UKPDS results were stunning—stunningly bad,
that is. Intensive treatment produced almost no measurable benefits.
Sure, it successfully lowered the average blood glucose, but the higher
dosages of medication resulted in more weight gain, by an average of 2.9
kg (6.4 pounds). In particular, those in the insulin group gained an
average of 4 kg (8.8 pounds). Hypoglycemic reactions significantly
increased, too, but these side effects were expected. Instead of mirroring
the significant benefits of the DCCT trial, there was only some minor
benefit in reducing eye disease. Ten years of tight blood glucose control
produced no cardiovascular benefits: there were no fewer heart attacks
or strokes. That discrepancy was shocking, but the story would get
stranger still.
Metformin was considered separately in UKPDS sub-study 34,8 which
focused on overweight type 2 diabetic patients. Metformin lowered the
hemoglobin A1C blood glucose level from 8.0 percent to 7.4 percent.
This was good, but not as good as the results seen with the more
powerful insulin and SU medications. Despite the mediocre blood glucose
reductions, however, the cardiovascular results were spectacular.
Metformin reduced diabetes-related death by a jaw-dropping 42 percent
and the risk of heart attack by a whopping 39 percent, greatly
outperforming the more powerful blood glucose–lowering agents. In other
words, which specific type of diabetic medication you took made a huge
difference. Metformin could save lives where the others could not, but its
benefit had little or nothing to do with its blood glucose–lowering effect.
The glucotoxicity paradigm, proven in type 1 diabetes, failed miserably in
type 2.
The Cochrane group, a well-respected independent group of
physicians and researchers, later estimated that glucose control was only
responsible for a miniscule 5–15 percent of the risk of cardiovascular
disease.9 Yet that still wasn’t the end of the story. Tired of all the
controversy, and still confident of the glucotoxicity paradigm in type 2
diabetes, the National Institutes for Health in the United States funded
the massive Action to Control Cardiac Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)
randomized study,10 which began in 1999.
The ACCORD study recruited more than 10,000 type 2 adult diabetics
across North America who were considered at high risk for heart attack
and stroke. The trial was designed, in part, to test whether taking
medications for intensive blood glucose control would reduce the risk of
heart attack, stroke, death from cardiovascular disease, and other
cardiovascular events.
One group of patients received standard treatment. The other group
received high doses of medications and insulin to reduce blood glucose
to as close to normal as possible. The first results from the ACCORD study
were published in 2008 and proved that intensive medical therapy could
reduce the A1C. Great. Did this make any difference to health? It sure
did. Intensive treatment was killing people. Completely contrary to
expectations, intensively treated patients were dying 22 percent faster
than the standard treatment group, in spite of—or perhaps because of—
the intervention. This equaled one extra death for every ninety-five
patients treated. The study could not ethically be allowed to continue.
Many similar studies finished around the same time. The results of the
randomized Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease Controlled
Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial, which looked at intensive blood glucose control
and vascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, were published
simultaneously with the ACCORD results.11 Once again, this blood
glucose–reducing strategy failed to deliver cardiovascular benefits;
thankfully, it also failed to increase mortality. In contrast, blood pressure–
lowering medications reduced cardiovascular disease, as expected. So
certain medications did truly benefit type 2 diabetic patients, but those
that reduced blood glucose did not.
Two further randomized controlled trials quickly followed to confirm
these disappointing results. The Veterans Affairs’ Diabetes Trial (VADT)
found that intensive medical therapy produced no significant benefits to
heart, kidney, or eye disease.12 The Outcome Reduction with an Initial
Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial treated prediabetics with early initiation
of insulin.13 There was no reduction in heart disease, stroke, eye
disease, peripheral vascular disease, or any measurable health benefits.
The classic medications for type 2 diabetes, including insulin, metformin,
TZDs, and SUs, had utterly failed to improve health.
The ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT trials all followed up with patients in
the longer term and published extended results,14 but these yielded little
new information. All the trials agreed that intensive glucose control with
medications did not save lives and had marginal, if any, benefits.
Furthermore, there were serious side effects, including an increased risk
of hypoglycemic reactions. The most obvious concern was the well-
known propensity of SUs, TZDs, and insulin to cause weight gain in patients
who were already obese, which could lead to cardiovascular problems
down the line. Metformin, which does not raise insulin, does not cause
obesity and this was the crucial difference.
Peer-reviewed commentary from 1999 reveals that concerns were
already percolating about the real issue: exacerbating hyperinsulinemia
in a patient who already had too much insulin. Dr. Richard Donnelly from
the University of Nottingham, U.K., wrote, “The findings could also be
interpreted as indicating that insulin and sulphonylureas are equally
harmful in the obese, possibly as a consequence of hyperinsulinaemia.”15
In type 1 diabetes, blood insulin is low, so replacing insulin is logical.
In type 2, blood insulin is high, so giving more insulin seems problematic.
After all, giving more alcohol to an alcoholic is not a winning strategy.
Using heating blankets on a heat stroke victim is not a winning strategy.
Treating sunburn by getting more sun is not a winning strategy. And
giving more insulin to somebody with too much insulin is not a winning
strategy. Logically, effectively treating type 2 diabetes requires an
approach to lower both glucose and insulin, thereby minimizing both
glucotoxicity and insulin toxicity.
INSULIN TOXICITY AND DOUBLE DIABETES
SINCE INTENSIVE GLUCOSE control using insulin caused weight gain and
metabolic syndrome—hallmarks of hyperinsulinemia—in both type 1 and
type 2 diabetics, and since type 1 diabetics produce none of their own
insulin, this hyperinsulinemia could only be iatrogenic (caused by the
treatment). Sound familiar? Hyperinsulinemia leads to insulin resistance.
In type 1 diabetics, too much insulin causes the same exact problems
found in type 2 diabetes. In other words, heavy dosing of insulin in type 1
diabetes creates type 2 diabetes. These patients essentially develop so-
called double diabetes: they produce none of their own insulin and yet
have all the problems of hyperinsulinemia due to exogenous injection.
Too much insulin causes insulin toxicity.
Type 1 diabetics suffered all the same diseases as type 2 diabetics,
but hyperglycemia was not the causal link. Hyperinsulinemia was the link.
The European Diabetes Prospective Complications Study (EURODIAB
study)16 looked for factors that predicted risk of death for type 1 diabetics.
It found that glucotoxicity, as measured by hemoglobin A1C, was not a
significant risk factor. Instead, the most important modifiable risk factors
were waist-to-hip ratio (a measure of visceral fat), blood pressure, and
cholesterol—all markers of metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia.
Many other studies confirmed the EURODIAB results. For example, the
Golden Years Cohort Study17 followed 400 patients with type 1 diabetes
who lived for over fifty years with their disease. They had beaten the
odds and survived. What was their secret? Well, it certainly was not tight
blood glucose control. Their average A1C was 7.6 percent, with some as
high as 8.5 to 9.0 percent, which is well above the standard
recommended target of 7.0 percent. In fact, not a single Golden Years
Cohort patient had an A1C in the normal range, ruling out glucotoxicity as
a major player. The entire Golden Years Cohort of survivors had
suboptimal blood glucose control and yet their health was excellent. The
common factor was a low insulin dosage. Obesity, high blood pressure,
and other manifestations of hyperinsulinemia were notably absent.
There are two toxicities at work here. Early on in type 1 diabetes,
glucotoxicity is the main concern. In type 1 diabetics, this is caused by
the body’s inability to produce enough insulin. In type 2 diabetics, it’s the
effect of insulin resistance. But, in either type 1 or type 2, if you
continually raise the dosage of insulin to lower blood glucose, you simply
trade higher insulin toxicity for less glucotoxicity. And over time, insulin
toxicity becomes the key determinant for survival because it leads to
metabolic syndrome and its sequelae, cardiovascular disease and
cancer. The optimal treatment strategy reduces both blood glucose and
insulin simultaneously.
Type 2 DiabetesVille: A parable
REMEMBER THE JAPANESE subway pushers from chapter 6? How they were
shoving more and more people into subway cars already bursting with
passengers? And how ridiculous a solution that seems to dealing with the
problem? That’s exactly what happens when we use insulin to treat type
2 diabetes.
When I tell my patients with type 2 diabetes what’s happening in their
bodies, I use a slightly different analogy. Instead of cells in your body or
passengers on a subway car, imagine you live on Liver Street in a town
called DiabetesVille. Everybody is friendly and leaves their door open
and unlocked. Three times a day, Mr. Insulin drives down the streets and
delivers a small cup of glucose to each house for residents to enjoy. Life
is going well, and everybody is happy.
Gradually, over time, Mr. Insulin comes around more and more often,
and soon he’s dropping off whole heaping buckets of glucose. He needs
to empty his glucose truck every night, or he’ll lose his job. For a while,
you store the excess glucose in your house and life goes on. But finally
your house is completely filled with glucose, which is starting to rot and
stink. You try to reason with Mr. Insulin, but to no avail. Every house on
every street has the same problem.
Now what do you do? Exasperated, you shout, “I don’t want this toxic
glucose! I’ve got too much already, and I don’t want anymore.” You lock
the front door so Mr. Insulin can’t shove any more toxic stuff into your
house. A little glucose was fine, but this amount is getting ridiculous. The
dose makes the poison. You are simply protecting your house by
resisting Mr. Insulin’s toxic glucose load. That’s insulin resistance!
Mr. Insulin now finds it harder and harder to get rid of his glucose load
and is worried he’s going to get fired. So he asks his brothers to help.
They break down your door and shovel in barrels of glucose—until you
increase your front door’s resistance with steel bars. It’s a race between
Mr. Insulin finding more Insulin henchmen, and you increasing resistance.
More insulin leads to more resistance, and more resistance leads to more
insulin.
With so much glucose stored inside the house, you turn it into fat,
package it, and send it out to your friends on Pancreas Avenue, Skeletal
Muscle Drive, and elsewhere. (In our cells at this point, the glucose has
stimulated insulin and flooded the liver, which has activated DNL to
transform this glucose into new molecules of fat. The excess fat is
accumulating in the liver causing damage, so the engorged liver
decompresses itself by moving this fat out to the pancreas, skeletal
muscle, and around the abdominal organs. Meanwhile, insulin is still
trying to force glucose inside, and the liver cells protect themselves by
increasing insulin resistance.)
Back in DiabetesVille, all the doors have been triple-barred and
guarded by dogs—big dogs. The Insulin brothers are now unable to
deliver their huge glucose burden. Glucose is spilling over into the
streets. Unsure what else to do, the specialist Dr. Endocrine steps in. He
decides that the glucose is indeed toxic, and the streets must be cleared
immediately.
Despite the hordes of Insulin clansmen prowling around, Dr. Endo
decides that the best solution is to use even more insulin. He hires more
Insulin thugs to shove more glucose into the reluctant houses, clearing
off the streets. He gives himself a pat on the back. “Look,” he says, “the
streets are nice and clean.”
But eventually the houses fill up again, and increase their resistance
yet again. Even the extra Insulin cronies cannot shove any more glucose
in. Does Dr. Endo get rid of some of the glucose? Does he stop glucose
from coming into the city? No! He has only learned one solution to every
problem: give more insulin. To a man with a hammer, everything looks
like a nail.
In our bodies, excessive sugar has led to too much insulin. Yet the
currently accepted solution is to prescribe even more insulin. If insulin
levels were already high, why would you want to give more? Instead of
eliminating the sugar, insulin merely moves it around the body into all the
organs. Higher insulin doses only create more insulin resistance. Even
while the symptom of high blood glucose improves, the disease of type 2
diabetes worsens.
We accept that high blood glucose levels are harmful. But here’s a
question seldom asked. If this high glucose level were toxic in the blood,
why wouldn’t it also be toxic inside the cells? As glucose enters the cells
faster than it can be used for energy, it accumulates inside the cell. The
reason insulin resistance develops in all the organs and in all peoples of
the world is precisely to shield against this toxic sugar load. It’s a good
thing, not a bad one.
Insulin doesn’t actually eliminate glucose from the body; it merely
shoves the excess glucose out of the blood and forces it into the cells,
somewhere, anywhere: eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart. Over time, all the
organs simply start rotting from too much glucose. Using medications like
insulin to hide the blood glucose in the tissues of the body is ultimately
destructive. The key to the proper treatment of type 2 diabetes is to get
rid of the excess sugar, not just move it around the body. The problem is
both too much glucose and too much insulin.
HYPERINSULINEMIA, INSULIN TOXICITY, AND DISEASE
HYPERINSULINEMIA WAS CONSIDERED a potential problem as far back as
1924,18 but only more recently have researchers started to look closely at
the data, and the evidence is everywhere.19 Too much insulin leads to
insulin toxicity, which is strongly associated with many diseases.20
Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease
WHILE TYPE 2 diabetes is associated with numerous complications,
including nerve, kidney, and eye damage, the morbidity and mortality
associated with cardiovascular diseases is the most important.21 Simply
put, most diabetic patients die of cardiovascular disease. As early as
1949, animal studies demonstrated that insulin treatment causes early
atherosclerosis, also called hardening of the arteries, which is a
precursor to heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease.
Insulin facilitates every single step along the inflammatory pathway that
marks the progression of the disease, including initiation, inflammation,
foam cell (fat-laden cell) formation, fibrous plaque formation, and
advanced lesions.22 Moreover, fibrous plaque contains insulin
receptors,23 and insulin stimulates the growth of plaque, which
accelerates the atherosclerosis and substantially raises the risk of
cardiovascular disease. Experimentally, these same studies showed that
preventing the excessive insulin could reverse the condition.24
If you are not on diabetes medications, the risk of heart disease
increases with the degree of hyperglycemia.25 Insulin lowers blood
glucose, so it has always been assumed it would protect against disease.
But that is only true if glucotoxicity causes the heart disease, which it
does not. What has not generally been appreciated is that, if you are not
on diabetes medications, the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the
severity of diabetes. Trading insulin toxicity for glucotoxicity is not
obviously beneficial.
The UK General Practice Database identified more than 84,000 newly
diagnosed diabetics between 2000 and 2010.26 Treatment with insulin
did not lower heart disease risk; rather, it more than doubled the risk of
death. The same held true for heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and kidney
disease. Insulin could reduce blood glucose but not heart disease or
death.27 Patients with an A1C blood glucose level of 6.0 percent, which
was considered excellent control, fared just as poorly as those patients
with an A1C of 10.5 percent, which is considered uncontrolled diabetes.28
Ultimately, heavy-handed use of insulin could reduce glucotoxicity, but
only at the expense of insulin toxicity. As in type 1 diabetes, high insulin
doses were not good; they were bad.
Figure 10.2. Insulin use and increased risk of mortality in type 2 diabetes29
These results were not new. Reviews of large population databases,
such as the 1996 Quebec Cardiovascular Study, established
hyperinsulinemia as a prime risk factor for heart disease.30 In
Saskatchewan, Canada, a review of more than twelve thousand newly
diagnosed diabetic patients found a “significant and graded association
between mortality risk and insulin exposure level.”31 It wasn’t a trivial
effect, either. The high-insulin group had a 279 percent higher risk of
death compared to those that did not use insulin. Treating type 2
diabetes with insulin was not good; it was bad. Simply put, the higher the
insulin dose, the higher the risk of dying.
Moreover, the longer the treatment time with insulin, the greater the
risk of cardiovascular disease.32 A 2011 study showed that both low and
high blood glucose carried excess risk of death, again reflecting the dual
toxicities of glucose and insulin. Once again, insulin use was associated
with a mind-boggling 265 percent increased risk of death.33
A Cardiff University review of almost 10 percent of the U.K. population
from 2004 to 2015 found that lower A1C was associated with elevated
mortality risk, driven mainly by a 53 percent increased risk with the use of
insulin.34 In this study, no other medication increased the risk of death. A
Dutch database associated high daily insulin doses with three times the
cardiovascular risk.35 In heart failure patients, insulin use is associated
with more than four times the risk of death.36
Excessive insulin is toxic, particularly in a setting of type 2 diabetes,
where baseline insulin is already very high. Giving more insulin will lower
the blood glucose, but worsen the underlying hyperinsulinemia. Trading
insulin toxicity for glucotoxicity is not beneficial.
Cancer
DIABETES, AS WELL as obesity and prediabetes, increases the risk of many
different types of cancer, including breast, colon, endometrial, kidney, and
bladder cancers.37 This suggests that factors other than increased blood
glucose play a major role in the development of cancers, further
disproving the glucotoxicity paradigm as the major cause of disease.38
Insulin, a hormone well known to promote growth, can drive tumor
growth, and women with the highest insulin levels carry a 2.4-fold higher
risk of breast cancer.39 Obesity may be a contributing factor, but
hyperinsulinemia is associated with an increased risk of cancer,
independent of weight. Lean and overweight women, when matched for
insulin level, exhibit the same risk of breast cancer.
The intimate link between insulin and cancer is reinforced by the
discovery of a single mutation in the PTEN oncogene that significantly
increases the risk of cancer.40 What’s the connection? This mutation
increases the insulin effect. It lowers the blood glucose and reduces the
risk of diabetes, but increases the risk of obesity and cancer.
Similarly, medications that raise insulin toxicity are associated with
higher rates of cancer. Insulin use increases the risk of colon cancer by
approximately 20 percent per year of therapy.41 The UK General Practice
Database revealed that insulin increased the risk of cancer by 42 percent
compared with a glucose-lowering drug that did not raise insulin.42 And a
review of the newly diagnosed diabetics in the Saskatchewan population
disclosed that use of insulin raised the risk of cancer by 90 percent.43
It’s simple to understand why high insulin levels should favor cancer
cell growth. First, insulin is a known hormonal growth factor. Second,
cancer cells are highly metabolically active and need large supplies of
glucose to proliferate. Insulin increases the risk of cancer, and once
cancer has been established, high blood glucose enables it to grow
faster.
ORAL HYPOGLYCEMICS:
NOT THE ANSWER
AS OF 2012, more than 50 percent of the American population has diabetes
or prediabetes.1 This stunning statistic means more people in the United
States have prediabetes or diabetes than not. It’s the new normal. It’s
also made selling insulin and insulin-like drugs the money-making
opportunity of a lifetime, which may explain why it continues to be
prescribed for prediabetics and type 2 diabetics when it doesn’t make
sense.
In 2008, a joint statement released by the American College of
Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists
encouraged physicians to consider drug treatment of prediabetic patients
despite the fact that no drug had yet been approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.2
In 2010, the definition of type 2 diabetes was broadened, ostensibly to
help with early diagnosis and treatment. It is perhaps no coincidence that
nine of the fourteen outside experts on the panel that made this
recommendation worked in various capacities with the giant
pharmaceutical companies that made diabetes medications and stood
directly in the path of an unending torrent of money. In the lead-up to this
decision, individual members received millions of dollars and the
American Diabetes Association itself reaped more than $7 million in 2004
alone from its pharmaceutical “partners.”3
When Dr. Banting discovered insulin in 1921, he licenced the drug to
pharmaceutical companies without a patent because he fervently
believed this life-saving miracle should be made available to everybody
who needed it. Yet, insulin—now available in many different formulations
—is estimated to have cost the U.S. health care system $6 billion in
2012,4 driven in part by steep price increases. Between 2010 and 2015,
these newer insulins increased in price from 168 to 325 percent. In 2013,
Lantus, a long-acting form of insulin, earned $7.6 billion, making it the
world’s bestselling diabetes drug. Various other insulins took another six
of the top ten spots on that list.
Between 2004 and 2013, no less than thirty new diabetes drugs came
to market. Despite several setbacks, by 2015 sales of diabetes drugs had
reached $23 billion, which is more than the combined revenue of the
National Football League, Major League Baseball, and the National
Basketball Association.5
Figure 11.1. Increasing variety of diabetic medications6
The focus of treatment of type 2 diabetes has always been to lower
blood glucose because it is associated with better health outcomes.
Every 1 percent increase in the hemoglobin A1C is associated with an 18
percent increase in risk of cardiovascular events, 12 to 14 percent
increase in the risk of death, and 37 percent increase in risk of eye
disease or kidney disease.7
But correlation is not causation. Lowering blood glucose with
medications, as opposed to diet and lifestyle, is not necessarily
beneficial. Consider two type 2 diabetic patients with an identical A1C of
6.5 percent. One takes no medications and the other uses 200 units of
insulin daily. These might seem like identical situations, but they’re not.
The first situation reflects mild diabetes while the other reflects severe
diabetes. The use of insulin does not change severe type 2 diabetes into
mild type 2 diabetes. The cardiovascular risks are completely different.
Indeed, insulin may not have any benefits at all.
No evidence exists that these newer insulins are any more effective
than the original. Indeed, health outcomes for type 2 diabetes have only
worsened even as these newer insulins have become more widely
prescribed. And exogenous insulin injections are no longer just for type 1
diabetes. Almost one-third of diabetics in the United States currently use
some form of insulin.8 This statistic is slightly horrifying, considering that
90 to 95 percent of diabetes in the United States is type 2, for which the
benefits of insulin are highly questionable.
In fact, other medications are available for type 2 diabetes. Several
classes of drugs are or have been available through the years, and are
still being prescribed to a bigger and bigger group of patients. Despite
their popularity among doctors, these blood glucose–lowering pills—oral
hypoglycemics in medicalspeak—are not long-term solutions to diabetes,
either. I divide these medications into three categories based upon their
effect on insulin and thus body weight. In general, the more they raise
insulin levels, the more they cause weight gain and many of the
complications associated with diabetes.
MEDICATIONS THAT CAUSE WEIGHT GAIN
Sulfonylureas (SUs)
SULFONYLUREAS STIMULATE THE pancreas to produce more insulin, thereby
effectively reducing blood sugars. The sulfonylurea (SU) drug class was
discovered in 1942 and has been widely prescribed since then. By 1984,
more powerful second-generation SUs had been introduced in the United
States. The most commonly used drugs in this class include glyburide,
glipizide, and glicizide.
In its research on type 2 diabetes, the United Kingdom Prospective
Diabetes Study (UKPDS; see chapter 10) demonstrated that intensive
treatment with the SU class of drugs produced almost no benefits in
controlling the long-term complications of diabetes. Of particular concern
was that exacerbating weight gain in already obese patients could lead to
cardiovascular problems down the line. Extended follow-up of the original
UKPDS study showed only mild cardiovascular benefits: the death rate was
reduced by 13 percent.9 The paradigm of glucotoxicity was established
for type 2 diabetes, but only barely. Blood glucose–lowering medications
had marginal benefits that took twenty years to become apparent. The
risk associated with increasing insulin, with its accompanying weight
gain, could barely offset the benefit of lowering glucose.
Further studies have borne out these concerns. A 2012 review of
more than 250,000 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics in the Veterans
Affairs database across the United States showed that starting treatment
with SUs instead of metformin carries a 21 percent higher risk of
cardiovascular disease.10 Studies from the U.K. and elsewhere estimate
the use of SUs increases the risk of heart attack or death by 40 to 60
percent.11 Furthermore, these risks increase in a dose-dependent
manner.12 That is, the higher the dose of SU, the greater the
cardiovascular risk.
A 2012 randomized, controlled trial, the gold standard of evidence-
based medicine, confirmed that initial therapy with SUs compared to
metformin increases the risk of vascular disease by 40 percent13 despite
equal blood glucose control. The importance of this study cannot be
underestimated. Two drugs that control blood glucose equally could have
widely divergent effects on cardiovascular health. The main difference?
One stimulates insulin and causes weight gain whereas the other does
not. Glucotoxicity is equal, so the difference is the insulin toxicity of SUs.
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)
DURING THE 1980s and 1990s, drug companies did not develop a single
new oral hypoglycemic agent because the number of patients using them
was too small and the benefit was dubious. But the growing number of
diabetics and prediabetics changed the economics of diabetic
medications completely. In 1999, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the first new diabetes drug class in more than a decade, the
thiazolidinediones (TZDs). These drugs bind to receptors in the fat cells,
making them more sensitive to insulin and thereby amplifying insulin’s
effects. So TZDs such as rosiglitazone, sold under the brand name
Avandia, and pioglitazone, sold as Actos, lower blood glucose but do not
raise insulin levels; instead, they help the body use the available insulin
more effectively.
Predictably, research showed TZDs’ magnifying effect was both
positive and negative. Blood glucose was lowered, but patients could
reliably expect to gain 3 to 4 kilograms (6.6 to 8.8 pounds) of fat, as
insulin is a key driver of weight gain. They also retained fluid, typically
around the ankles but sometimes in the lungs, which caused shortness of
breath and congestive heart failure. These setbacks were mild, but worse
was still to come.
By 2007, the influential New England Journal of Medicine reported
that rosiglitazone unexpectedly increased the risk of heart attacks.14 The
FDA hastily convened an advisory board of independent experts that
same year;15 similar deliberations took place in Europe. The FDA
investigated concerns of data tampering in the Residential Environment
and Coronary Heart Disease (RECORD) study, one of the largest trials that
had “proved” the safety of rosiglitazone, and eventually concluded that
the concerns about heart disease were well placed.16 Rosiglitazone was
associated with a 25 percent higher risk of heart attack.
By 2011, Europe, the U.K., India, New Zealand, and South Africa had
all banned the use of rosiglitazone, though the FDA continued to allow its
sale in the United States with a warning label for patients. These
concerns devastated sales. Doctors stopped prescribing the medication,
patients refused to take it, and by 2012, sales had fallen to a paltry $9.5
million.
The debacle left some beneficial policy changes in its wake. All
diabetes medications henceforth were required to conduct large-scale
safety trials to safeguard the public interest. Dr. Clifford Rosen, the
chairperson of that FDA committee, clearly identified the key problem.
New drugs were approved based solely on their ability to lower blood
glucose, under the unproven assumption that this effect would reduce the
cardiovascular burden. However, the evidence to date, including the
UKPDS, ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT, and ORIGIN studies, had failed to confirm
these theorized benefits. Lowering blood glucose had little to do with
protecting against the organ damage of type 2 diabetes.
A second TZD, pioglitazone, faced its own concerns about bladder
cancer. Compared to other diabetes medications, the use of pioglitazone
is associated with a 63 percent increased risk of bladder cancer.17 The
risk rises with longer duration of use and higher dosages.
The known side effects of weight gain and fluid retention were enough
to give physicians pause, but these new concerns about cardiovascular
and cancer risks effectively sealed the fate of the TZD drug class. In North
America, they are very rarely prescribed and usage has effectively
ceased.
MEDICATIONS THAT ARE WEIGHT NEUTRAL
Metformin
METFORMIN, THE MOST powerful of the biguanide class of medications, was
discovered shortly after insulin and described in the scientific literature in
1922. By 1929, its sugar-lowering effect was noted in animal studies, but
it was not until 1957 that it was first used in humans for the treatment of
diabetes. Biguanides work by blocking gluconeogenesis and thereby
preventing the liver from producing glucose. This effect lowers the risk of
hypoglycemia and weight gain because it does not increase insulin levels
in the body.
Metformin entered the British National Formulary in 1958 and was
introduced in Canada in 1972. The FDA did not approve it in the United
States until 1994 due to concerns about an extremely rare side effect
called lactic acidosis. However, given the powerful lifesaving effect
demonstrated in the UKPDS compared to other comparable diabetes
drugs, the benefits are felt to be well worth the risk and it has become the
most widely prescribed diabetes drug in the world.
Since metformin does not raise insulin, it does not cause obesity and
therefore does not worsen diabetes. So metformin sounds pretty good.
The problem is that metformin (and other biguanides) does not take away
the root cause of the illness—that is, they do not rid the body of excess
sugar. Remember, hyperinsulinemia causes type 2 diabetes. While these
drugs target blood glucose, they do little to relieve the underlying
hyperinsulinemia. They take care of the symptom but, since they do not
eliminate the cause, insulin resistance continues to rise and diabetes is
managed but not eliminated.
Clinically, this is obvious. Once started on metformin, it is highly
unlikely that one will ever be able to stop it without intensive lifestyle
changes. Therefore, metformin may manage the disease for a while, but
eventually, the patient will require higher and higher doses. The
underlying disease process continues progressing, solemn as a
clergyman.
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors
IN 2006, the FDA approved a new class of medications called the dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. These drugs are designed to lower blood
glucose by blocking the breakdown of incretins, which are hormones
released in the stomach that increase insulin secretion in response to
food. High incretin levels stimulate insulin release; however, this insulin
response is not sustained and therefore these drugs do not cause weight
gain. The risk of hypoglycemia is also low.
Hopes were high for this new class of medication, but a study
completed in 2013, called the SAVOR study18 (Saxagliptin Assessment Of
Vascular Outcomes Recorded In Patients With Diabetes Mellitus), along
with 2015’s Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin
(TECOS) study,19 soon dashed these hopes. The FDA mandated both
randomized controlled trials after the rosiglitazone debacle and neither
found safety concerns with the long-term use of these medications.
However, neither were there any protective effects against cardiovascular
diseases. These medications effectively lowered blood glucose but did
not reduce heart attacks or strokes. Once again, the glucotoxicity
paradigm was proven false. Yes, you could reduce blood glucose, but,
no, you were not any healthier for it.
In spite of that, the fact that these medications were at least not killing
people was apparently a good enough reason to prescribe them. In 2015,
the top DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, raked in $3.86 billion, enough to rank it
as the second bestselling diabetes drug in the world, trailing only Lantus,
a long-acting form of insulin.20
MEDICATIONS THAT CAUSE WEIGHT LOSS
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors
THE NEWEST CLASS of medications, called sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
(SGLT2) inhibitors, block glucose reabsorption in the kidney, allowing
glucose to escape in the urine, which replicates the protective
mechanism used by the body during severe hyperglycemia. What
happens if you don’t block this protective mechanism, but enhance it?
Where the classic diabetes drugs increase insulin, the SGLT2
inhibitors lower it21 by forcing the excretion of glucose outside the body.
The result is lower blood glucose, but also lower body weight, blood
pressure, and markers of arterial stiffness.22 As the root cause of
diabesity is hyperinsulinemia, here, at long last, was a drug that
effectively lowered insulin. Would this finally translate into proven
cardiovascular benefits?
It wasn’t just a home run; it was a grand slam. A 2015 study called the
EMPA-REG study (Empagliflozin: Cardiovascular (CV) Outcomes and
Mortality in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus)23 revealed that the
SLGT2s reduced the risk of death by an incredible 38 percent. The good
news did not stop there. It reduced the risk of progression of kidney
disease by almost 40 percent and the need for dialysis by a stunning 55
percent.24 The elusive cardiovascular and renal benefits that virtually
every previous study had failed to deliver were finally found.
Tellingly, the blood glucose–lowering effect was very modest. The
A1C only dropped by 0.47 percent, far less than almost every other
medication currently in use, but the benefits were far greater. This result
once again underscored that glucotoxicity is a minor-league player. The
SGLT2 inhibitors simultaneously lowered both insulin toxicity and
glucotoxicity, and the results were nothing short of amazing.
Weight loss is one of the most noticeable side benefits of this class of
medication. Not only did patients lose weight, unlike virtually every other
dietary trial, they kept the weight off even after the two years.
Canagliflozin, for example, helped patients lose an extra 2.9 kg of body
weight and keep it off.25
The main side effect of this class of medications is the increased risk
of urinary tract infections and yeast infections due to increased urinary
glucose concentration. However, these infections were generally mild and
treatable. The most serious side effect was an increased risk of
ketoacidosis. The combination of proven organ protection, lowered blood
glucose, lowered insulin, and weight loss is a powerful incentive for
physicians to prescribe these new drugs. Sales have been rising sharply
as of 2017, with some analysts predicting that sales could hit $6 billion by
2020.26
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors
DESPITE THE HOOPLA, the SGLT2 was not actually the first oral hypoglycemic
agent to show proven cardiovascular benefits. Another now largely
forgotten drug was previously shown to have similar benefits. Acarbose is
an oral diabetes medication first introduced in the United States in 1996.
It blocks the enzymes alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, both of
which are required for proper digestion of carbohydrates. Blocking these
enzymes prevents complex carbohydrates, which are chains of glucose,
from breaking into smaller glucose molecules, thus reducing absorption.
Acarbose is essentially the drug equivalent of a low-carbohydrate diet.
The 2003 Study to Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus
(STOP-NIDDM)27 trial showed that acarbose, despite relatively unimpressive
lowering of blood glucose, reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by a
remarkable 49 percent and hypertension by 34 percent. In addition to
these unprecedented benefits, acarbose also reduced body weight by
1.41 kilograms and waist circumference by 0.79 cm. These results could
have been predicted, since blocking absorption of dietary carbohydrates
would be expected to lower insulin levels.
At the time of publication, the benefits were ascribed to the blood
glucose–lowering effect, and it was expected that more powerful blood
glucose–lowering medications would deliver even more impressive
benefits. Yet by 2008, the ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT, and ORIGIN trials had
conclusively demonstrated no benefits to blood glucose lowering.
Acarbose succeeded precisely where other medications failed
because it reduces both glucotoxicity and insulin toxicity rather than
trading one for the other. It is still widely used in China and parts of Asia
due to its low cost but is now far less popular in North America because
its blood glucose–lowering effect is less powerful and bloating is a
bothersome side effect.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogs
GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE 1 (GLP-1) analogs are diabetic medications that
mimic the effect of the incretin hormones. Normally, the incretins secreted
by the stomach have several physiological roles when you eat food. They
increase the release of insulin but also slow down the motility of the
stomach and increase satiety. The DPP-4 inhibitors also enhance incretin
levels, but the GLP-1 analogs reach levels that are many times higher than
normal.
Incretins increase the insulin response to food, so blood glucose
decreases after meals. This transitory rise in insulin is not enough to
cause weight gain, but incretins slow the movement of food through the
stomach, causing satiety, decreased food intake, and weight loss. It also
accounts for the main side effect of nausea and vomiting. The 2016
LEADER trial of the GLP-1 analog Liraglutide showed that nausea occurred
four times more often in the drug group than the placebo group.28
Patients on the medication averaged 2.3 kg weight loss compared to
placebo and lowered their A1C by 0.4 percent.
The blood glucose–lowering effect was fairly modest but the
cardiovascular benefits were not. Liraglutide could reduce cardiovascular
disease and death by approximately 15 percent. While less powerful than
the SGLT2 inhibitor class or acarbose, it was still highly significant and
promised clinical benefits. Yet again, the glucotoxicity paradigm was
proved inadequate to explain what was happening. Clinical benefits only
accrue when both glucotoxicity and insulin toxicity are reduced.
A TRADE-OFF, NOT A SOLUTION
STANDARD MEDICATIONS FOR type 2 diabetes represent a trade-off between
glucotoxicity and insulin toxicity. Insulin, TZDs, and SUs all increase insulin
or its effect to reduce hyperglycemia. The effect of the increased insulin
becomes clinically obvious as weight gain. The price of better glucose
control has been higher insulin dosage, so there is no net benefit. These
medications simply trade lower glucotoxicity for higher insulin toxicity.
Metformin and DPP-4 medications use mechanisms other than raising
insulin to lower blood glucose. But they do not lower insulin either, so the
result is neither weight gain nor weight loss. Reducing glucotoxicity while
keeping insulin neutral produces minimal benefits. Clinically, these
medications are weight neutral, but also neutral with regard to
cardiovascular risk or benefits.
Acarbose, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 analogs all lower glucose but
also lower insulin and cause weight loss. Since type 2 diabetes is a
disease characterized by elevations in both blood glucose and blood
insulin, these medications would be predicted to have the best outcome.
And sure enough, that is the case. In a disease of too much insulin,
lowering it creates benefits. These three categories of medications could
easily be called the good (lowers insulin, body weight, and
complications), the bad (neutral), and the ugly (increases insulin, body
weight, and complications).

The classic oral hypoglycemic agents were exclusively those that
were insulin neutral or raised insulin levels. This explains how meta-
analyses reviewing all the available literature up to 2016, including twenty
randomized controlled trials, could only conclude that “there is no
significant evidence of long term efficacy of insulin on any clinical
outcome in T2D (type 2 diabetes). However, there is a trend to clinically
harmful adverse effects such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain.”29 In
other words, insulin treatment, including medications that simulate only
the blood glucose–lowering properties of insulin, carries no perceptible
benefits and significant risks. Insulin is “significantly more harmful than
other active treatments.”
A similar review in the Journal of the American Medical Association
that included all relevant trials up to March 2016 found that none of the
drug classes considered, including metformin, SUs, TZDs, and DPP-4
inhibitors, reduced cardiovascular disease or other complications.30
Importantly, these older medications did not reduce the hyperinsulinemia
that is the root problem, or indeed, made it worse. Again, diabetes will
continue unless we treat the root cause.
While the scientific evidence is crystal clear, diabetes guidelines are
slow to reflect this new reality. Dr. Victor Montori of the Mayo Clinic
discovered that 95 percent of published guidelines endorsed the use of
diabetes drugs despite their nonexistent benefits.31 Why would you take
medications that have no benefits? Worse, why would you take
medications that have no benefits and make you fat?
The classic medical treatment, which relies almost exclusively on
pharmaceuticals to reduce blood glucose, can therefore best be
described as how not to treat type 2 diabetes. By contrast, newer agents,
which can reduce both blood glucose and insulin levels, show proven
benefits to reduce heart and kidney complications of type 2 diabetes.
Nevertheless, these medications, while an important step forward, are
clearly not the answer; they do not reverse the root cause of type 2
diabetes—our diet. Following a low-fat, calorie-restricted diet and
increasing exercise have long been the recommended lifestyle treatment
for type 2 diabetes. There is only one problem with this seemingly
common sense advice. It doesn’t work at all.
LOW-CALORIE DIETS
AND EXERCISE:
NOT THE ANSWER
IN 2015, WHEN Dr. Sarah Hallberg stepped onto the stage at Purdue
University to deliver a TEDx talk1 about reversing diabetes, few in the
audience expected to hear what she was about to say: reversing type 2
diabetes starts with ignoring the guidelines.
Dr. Hallberg is the medical director of Indiana University’s weight loss
program, and she argued convincingly that the low-fat diet endorsed by
the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and countless medical
organizations was almost exactly wrong. These experts were hurting the
very patients they hoped to help. Instead, a simple dietary change had
the potential to significantly improve diabetes and help weight-loss
efforts.
Her lecture soon became an Internet sensation, quickly passing a
million views, and she was featured on radio and television and on the
front page of the New York Times Sunday Review.2 Her powerful
message of hope had struck a chord. And why? Because it made sense.
So, what exactly are these guidelines that we should ignore?
THE LOW-FAT ERA
IN THE EARLY 2000s, the monumental task of recommending an optimal
diet for type 2 diabetics was assigned to Dr. Richard Kahn, then the chief
medical and scientific officer of the ADA. Like any good scientist, he began
by reviewing the available published data. “When you look at the
literature, whoa is it weak. It is so weak,” he said.3 But that was not an
answer the ADA could give. People demanded dietary advice. So, without
any evidence to guide him one way or the other, Dr. Kahn went with the
generic advice given to the public at large: to eat a low-fat, high-
carbohydrate diet. “It’s a diet for all America,” he reasoned. Therefore, it
should be good for type 2 diabetics, too.
And where did that advice come from? In the U.S., the Senate Select
Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs first released its Dietary
Guidelines for Americans in 1977. Since 1980, the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and
Human Services have published a set of dietary guidelines every five
years. And in Canada, the federal government has been regularly
publishing and updating a food guide since 1942.
The food pyramids published in these guides have been informing our
food choices, and doctors’ recommendations, ever since. And the foods
at the base of the pyramid, the ones to be eaten preferentially, have been
grains and other refined carbohydrates. The “bread, rice, cereal, and
pasta” group, of which we were supposed to eat six to eleven servings
daily, comprise the exact foods that cause the greatest increase in blood
glucose. This is also the precise diet that has failed to halt the greatest
obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics the world has ever seen. But let’s
talk specifically about type 2 diabetes by juxtaposing two incontrovertible
facts:
1. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose.
2. Refined carbohydrates raise blood glucose levels more than any
other foods.
So type 2 diabetics should eat the very foods that raise blood glucose
the most? “Illogical” is the only word that comes to mind. Yet, not just the
USDA, but also the Diabetes UK, European Association for the Study of
Diabetes (EASD), Canadian Diabetes Association, American Heart
Association, and National Cholesterol Education Panel recommended
fairly similar diets. All of them suggested keeping carbohydrates at a lofty
50 to 60 percent of total calories and dietary fat at less than 30 percent.
The 2008 American Diabetes Association position statement on
nutrition advised: “Dietary strategies including reduced calories and
reduced intake of dietary fat, can reduce the risk for developing diabetes
and are therefore recommended.”4 The logic is hard to follow. Dietary fat
does not raise blood glucose. Reducing fat to emphasize carbohydrates,
which are known to raise blood glucose, could protect against diabetes?
How they believed that would work is unknown. It further advised, against
all common sense, that “intake of sucrose and sucrose-containing foods
by people with diabetes does not need to be restricted.” Eating sugar was
okay for type 2 diabetics? This could not realistically be expected to lower
blood glucose, and the proof came soon enough.
WHY THE LOW FAT ERA BACKFIRED
THE 2012 TREATMENT Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and
Youths (TODAY) randomized study5 reduced caloric intake to a miniscule
1200 to 1500 calories per day of a low-fat diet, combined with increased
exercise. This followed precisely the recommendations made by the 2008
ADA guidelines. Intensive dietary counseling was provided to ensure
compliance in this group of motivated teenagers. Massive effort by both
patients and study staff failed to improve blood glucose—and the failure
rate was astronomically high. Almost 50 percent of patients required
increased doses and numbers of medications. Whether or not patients
followed the recommended lifestyle recommendations did not matter at
all. Regardless, their diabetes was getting worse, not better. The scariest
part of the study was that if these teenagers couldn’t do it, what hope did
middle-aged or elderly adults have?
This classic “Eat Less, Move More” strategy failed yet again. But the
fact that this diet would not work should have been fairly obvious from the
beginning. Reducing dietary fat means increasing dietary carbohydrates,
since it is difficult to eat protein alone. In the Westernized world, these
carbohydrates were not leafy greens but the refined grains and sugars
that increase blood glucose and insulin maximally.
What was certainly behind the recommendation of a low-fat diet was
the belief that lowering dietary fat could protect against heart disease and
stroke. The most common cause of death in type 2 diabetes is
cardiovascular disease, which had been falsely attributed to dietary fat. It
must surely have been predicted that diabetes would worsen on this low-
fat but high-carbohydrate regimen, but presumably the benefits were felt
to be worth this risk. Upon closer inspection, these illusory benefits burst
like a ripe abscess.
By 1997, the Nurses’ Health Study (see chapter 4), a massive
observational study from Harvard University, found no relationship
between dietary fat or dietary cholesterol and heart disease.6 The final
nail in the coffin was the 2006 Women’s Health Initiative (also in chapter
4).7 Almost 50,000 women followed this low-fat, calorie-reduced diet for
more than eight years,8 yet the rates of heart disease and stroke did not
improve whatsoever. And despite good compliance with years of calorie
restriction, on average women lost less than a quarter of a pound.
There were absolutely no tangible benefits to long-term compliance
with a low-fat diet.9 Other studies quickly reached the same conclusions.
Despite forty years of research trying to link dietary fat, dietary
cholesterol, and heart disease, not a single shred of evidence could be
found.10
In diabetic patients, the story was the same. The Action for Health in
Diabetes (LookAHEAD) clinical trial studied more than 5000 obese patients
with type 2 diabetes at sixteen sites across the U.S. The researchers
compared a control group receiving standard diabetes intervention with a
second group that ate only 1200 to 1800 calories per day, less than 30
percent of them from fat, and did 175 minutes per week of moderate-
intensity physical activity.11 This was the recommended “intensive
lifestyle intervention” of every diabetes association in the world. Would it
reduce heart disease as promised?
In a word, no. In 2012, the trial was stopped early after 9.6 years of
high hopes. The data indicated there was no chance patients would show
cardiovascular benefits and continuing the study was futile. Researchers
threw in the towel. The low-fat, calorie-reduced diet had failed yet again.
All the scientific evidence has consistently refuted the dearly held
belief that reducing dietary fat would lead to weight loss and reduce heart
disease.12 Finally, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (the most
recent) have removed the limits on dietary fat intake to reflect this new
understanding, recognizing that there are a number of healthy fats, such
as those found in olive oil, nuts, and avocados. The low-fat, calorie-
reduced diet was a bust.
THE EXERCISE APPROACH
LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, TYPICALLY a combination of diet and exercise, are
a universally acknowledged mainstay of type 2 diabetes treatments.
These two stalwarts are often portrayed as equally beneficial, and why
not?
Exercise improves weight-loss efforts, although its effects are much
more modest than most assume. Nevertheless, physical inactivity is an
independent risk factor for more than twenty-five chronic diseases,
including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.13 Low levels of
physical activity in obese subjects are a better predictor of death than
cholesterol levels, smoking status, or blood pressure.14
And the benefits of exercise extend far beyond simple weight loss.
Exercise programs improve strength and balance, blood pressure,
cholesterol, blood glucose, and insulin sensitivity, without involving
medications and their potential side effects. Trained athletes have
consistently lower insulin levels, and these benefits can be maintained for
life, as demonstrated by many studies on older athletes. These seem like
good returns for a low-cost investment.
Yet results of both aerobic and resistance exercise studies in type 2
diabetes are varied.15, 16 Meta-analyses show that exercise may
significantly reduce A1C, without a change in body mass. This finding
suggests that exercise does not need to reduce body weight to have
benefits, which echoes clinical experience with patients. However, the
corollary is that exercise programs have minimal effect for weight loss.
With all the proven benefits of exercise, it may surprise you to learn
that I think this is not useful information. Why not? Because everybody
already knows this. The benefits of exercise have been extolled
relentlessly for the past forty years. I have yet to meet a single person
who has not already understood that exercise might help type 2 diabetes
and heart disease. If people already know its importance, what is the
point of telling them again?
The main problem has always been noncompliance. Many real issues
may deter someone from embarking on an exercise program: obesity
itself, joint pain, neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, back pain, and
heart disease may all combine to make exercise difficult or even unsafe.
Overall, however, I suspect the biggest issue is lack of visible results. The
benefits are greatly overhyped and exercise doesn’t work nearly as well
as advertised. Weight loss is often minimal. This lack of results despite
great effort is demoralizing.
THE DISAPPOINTING IMPACT OF EXERCISE
CONCEPTUALLY, EXERCISE SEEMS like an ideal way to burn off the excess
ingested calories of glucose. Standard recommendations are to exercise
thirty minutes per day, five days per week, for a total of 150 minutes per
week. At a modest pace, the result is an extra energy expenditure of 150
to 200 kcal per day, or 700 to 1000 kcal per week. These amounts pale in
comparison to a total energy intake of 14,000 calories per week.
In studies, all exercise programs produce substantially fewer benefits
than expected. There are two main reasons: First, exercise is known to
stimulate appetite. This tendency to eat more after exercise reduces
expected weight loss. Second, a formal exercise program tends to
decrease non-exercise activity. For example, if you have been doing hard
physical labor all day, you are unlikely to come home and run 10
kilometers for fun. On the other hand, if you’ve been sitting in front of the
computer all day, that 10-kilometer run might sound pretty good. These
compensation effects are a well-described phenomenon in exercise
studies. As you increase exercise intensity or duration, you may find that
you eat more or do fewer other non-exercise activities. These
compensations directly reduce the beneficial effects of the exercise
program.
In the end, the main problem is that type 2 diabetes is not caused by
lack of exercise. The underlying problem is excessive dietary glucose
and fructose causing hyperinsulinemia. Exercise can only improve insulin
resistance of the muscles. It does not improve insulin resistance in the
liver at all. The fatty liver is the key to developing type 2 diabetes, and
you cannot exercise your liver to health. Reversing type 2 diabetes
depends upon treating the root cause of the disease, which is dietary.
Imagine that you turn on your bathroom faucet full blast. The sink
starts to fill quickly, as the drain is small. Widening the drain slightly is not
the solution because it does not address the underlying problem. The
obvious solution is to turn off the faucet. In type 2 diabetes, a diet full of
refined carbohydrates and sugars is filling our bodies quickly with glucose
and fructose. Widening the drain by exercising is minimally effective. The
obvious solution is to turn off the faucet. And that leads us to the next
section, how to effectively treat type 2 diabetes.
ELENA
Elena, 63, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes three years
before I met her. She also had a history of high blood pressure,
high cholesterol, and obesity—the classic manifestations of
metabolic syndrome—and evidence of fatty liver damage. She
was taking metformin for diabetes as well as medications to
lower her blood pressure and cholesterol. Her A1C was 6.2%.
When Elena joined the IDM program, we discussed low-
carbohydrate, healthy-fat diets and she began a fasting
regimen of 36 hours, three times per week. Having long been
told to eat frequent small meals throughout the day, fasting
required a new mindset. Within two weeks of starting the
program, however, she was able to stop taking metformin. A
year after she began, she also stopped taking hypertension
medication, as her blood pressure had normalized. At our last
meeting, her A1C was 5.2%, which is well within the normal
range.
Today, Elena is considered nondiabetic. The blood markers
that indicate liver damage have completely normalized,
meaning she no longer suffers from the fatty liver that causes
chronic liver damage. Furthermore, she has dropped 60
pounds, lost 24 cm off her waist, and completely reversed her
metabolic syndrome.
RICHARD
Richard, 76, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about a
decade ago. In addition, he had high blood pressure, stroke,
peripheral vascular disease, an irregular heartbeat (atrial
fibrillation), and chronic kidney disease. Six years later he
started on insulin (36 units daily), in addition to two oral
hypoglycemics, yet his A1C remained elevated at 8.4%.
I met Richard just after he started taking insulin. Following
the IDM program, he began a low-carbohydrate, healthy-fat
diet and a 24-hour fast three days per week. Within a month he
was off insulin, and after six months he was completely off all
his oral medications, as well. His urine albumin-to-creatinine
ratio, a measure of diabetic kidney damage, dropped by two-
thirds; he lost 13 pounds; and his waist size shrank by 12 cm.
Today, Richard’s A1C is 5.4% without medications, which
classifies him as nondiabetic.
LESSONS FROM
BARIATRIC SURGERY
AT 203 KILOGRAMS (448 pounds), Adrian was morbidly obese and suffered
from type 2 diabetes. Medically unfit to work due to all his associated
illnesses, he lost his job in 2014. He eventually chose to undertake
weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, and within five weeks
his diabetes had completely disappeared.1 Interestingly, this story of type
2 diabetes reversal is not the exception but a general rule after surgery.
How often have we heard type 2 diabetes called a chronic and
progressive disease? This idea has only become accepted as if it were
fact because we have spent decades treating the symptom
(hyperglycemia) rather than the cause. Bariatric surgery proves that this
notion is simply mistaken: type 2 diabetes is a reversible and preventable
disease. When we treat the cause (hyperinsulinemia), we can reverse
diabetes. Remember Dr. Hallberg’s advice in chapter 12: ignore the
guidelines. What does bariatrics teach us about type 2 diabetes? Quite a
lot, it turns out.
EARLY ATTEMPTS AT WEIGHT-LOSS SURGERY
THE EARLIEST ATTEMPT to surgically cure obesity was to simply wire the
jaws shut. The logic is obvious, if not very imaginative. This restrictive
treatment, though, was ultimately unsuccessful. Patients could still drink
fluids, and enough high-calorie sugary drinks derailed weight loss. The
severe side effects were the limiting factor. Dental infections and vomiting
were insurmountable problems that often progressed over time. More
often than not, these intolerable problems led to reversing the surgery.2
In 1925, the Lancet noted that partial removal of the stomach for
peptic ulcer disease often caused weight loss and complete resolution of
sugar in the urine, now called diabetes.3 The smaller stomach volume
effectively reduced the amount a person could eat. Similar reports
followed sporadically in the 1950s and 1960s. This was an interesting
finding, but the results often did not endure. Over time, the smaller
stomach could expand and patients could eat normally. Weight would
rebound, and with it, type 2 diabetes.
Jejunocolic bypass surgery
THE MODERN AGE of bariatric surgery began in 1963 with the observation
that removal of the small bowel, which absorbs most of the ingested
nutrients, caused significant weight loss. This led to the development of
the jejunocolic bypass operation, in which bypassing the small bowel
reroutes food from the stomach directly to the colon. Success! Patients
lost significant amounts of weight using this malabsorptive approach.
But the side effects became immediately obvious. Bypassing the
small bowel did not allow the food to undergo the normal digestive
process. This was the point: if the food passed right through, it could not
hang around long enough to be absorbed and eventually stored as body
fat. Instead, this food energy was immediately excreted in the stool.
However, this rapid passage also meant essential food nutrients were not
absorbed properly or at all. Patients developed night blindness from
vitamin A deficiency, and osteoporosis from vitamin D deficiency. Other
common problems included severe diarrhea and bacterial overgrowth,
liver failure, and kidney stones. The continual diarrhea from the
malabsorbed fat led to anal excoriations and hemorrhoids. No fun. This
procedure, too, was soon abandoned.
Jejunoileal bypass
THESE COMPLICATIONS FORCED the switch to the less-intensive jejunoileal
bypass, in which most, but not all, of the small bowel is bypassed by
rerouting food from the stomach directly to a very short section of the
small bowel. Although absorption improved slightly, the complications
were still unacceptable, rendering this surgery a historical footnote.
However, this incremental improvement allowed others to build upon
these initial experiences.
In 1967, the seed of modern bariatric surgical procedures was planted
with the use of restrictive and malabsorptive components combined. This
approach physically limited the intake of food by removing most of the
stomach, and also reduced the absorption of whatever food made it
through. In addition to the partial bypass of the small bowel, part of the
stomach was removed. With the basic idea in place, further refinements
were added over time.
WEIGHT-LOSS SURGERY TODAY
COMPARED TO THE number of obese people in the United States, the
number of bariatric surgeries remains very small. In 2015, approximately
200,000 weight-loss surgeries were performed in the United States.4
Outside the U.S., this procedure is performed even less often, though
there are few reliable statistics.
Roux-En-Y gastric bypass
THE STANDARD FORM of bariatric surgery today is Roux-En-Y gastric
bypass, which takes its name from the creation of a blind loop of the
small bowel that makes a Y shape of the small intestines. Most of the
healthy stomach is removed until the only portion remaining is
approximately the size of a walnut, which severely restricts food intake.
By itself, this procedure serves as only a short-term solution, so the
second step of the surgery involves rerouting the small intestine to
prevent the absorption of most, but not all, of the ingested food.
This combined restrictive and malabsorptive procedure makes the
Roux-En-Y bypass the current heavyweight champion of bariatric
surgeries, with the best weight loss but also the most complications. This
surgery has “Go big or go home” tattooed on its massive bicep. In
addition to the usual risks of bleeding and infection common to all
surgeries, deficiencies of all nutrients, including proteins, vitamins, and
minerals, can lead to lifelong malnutrition after the bypass. Gastric
dumping syndrome, caused when food moves too quickly (is dumped)
from the surgically altered stomach to the small intestines, can cause
nausea, diarrhea, and facial flushing after meals. Strictures (abnormal
narrowings) due to scar tissue can occur at the surgical site and block the
passage to the stomach.
The Roux-En-Y surgery is often reserved for severe cases of obesity,
typically patients with a body mass index greater than 40. The side
effects, however, have led to the development of milder forms of bariatric
surgery that can also produce spectacular results without the complexity
or complications of the Roux-En-Y.
The sleeve gastrectomy
THE SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY simply removes a large portion of the healthy
stomach without altering the intestines, making it a purely restrictive form
of weight-loss surgery. It dramatically reduces the stomach’s capacity for
holding food. More than a thimbleful of food causes severe gastric
distention, ballooning of the miniature stomach, and persistent nausea
and vomiting. Over time, the remaining stomach stretches until it
becomes possible to eat small meals.
Since this procedure may be done laparoscopically—through a series
of small incisions—there tend to be fewer acute surgical complications
such as bleeding and infection. Although gastric dumping syndrome is
rare after this procedure, strictures are common. More importantly,
perhaps, compared to the Roux-En-Y surgery, it leads to less weight loss
and less durable results.
The gastric “lap” band
AN EVEN SIMPLER surgery is the surgically implanted gastric “lap” band that
wraps around the stomach. Like cinching a tight belt, the lap band
restricts food from entering the stomach. No part of the healthy stomach
is removed, and the lap band can be gradually tightened or loosened as
needed. Because of its relative simplicity, this procedure has the fewest
complications and can be used by anybody for weight loss. The main
problem is that weight is often regained over time. One surgeon, a friend,
remarked that the most common lap band surgery these days is its
removal.
Figure 13.1. Gastric lap banding
In the short term, all types of bariatric surgery have been proved
effective for weight loss and diabetes. Longer-term studies show varied
effectiveness,5 depending upon the type of surgery. However, I do not
wish to praise or condemn any of these surgeries. As with everything
else in medicine, they have their place. My main question is: what
happens to type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery? What does bariatric
surgery teach us?
WHY BARIATRIC SURGERY WORKS
IN VIRTUALLY ALL cases, type 2 diabetes completely disappears after
bariatric surgery. Type 2 diabetes is entirely reversible, even in a 500-
pound patient with a twenty-year duration of disease. It is not only
reversible, but rapidly reversible. In a matter of weeks, the diabetes
disappears. Yes, it truly just goes away.
Figure 13.2. Surgery cures diabetes6
A 2012 trial called Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially
Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE)7 compared the effects of gastric
bypass surgery with intensive medical therapy (drug treatments) on
obese type 2 diabetics with very high blood glucose levels. Surgical
patients did amazingly well. Within three months, most patients stopped
taking all their diabetic medications because their blood glucose had
normalized, often long before they noticed substantial weight loss.
Technically, these patients no longer had diabetes. In other words, type 2
diabetes is reversible—even curable.
By contrast, the patients in the intensive medical therapy group
experienced no improvement in their disease over time. They continued
to require ever-increasing doses of medications for type 2 diabetes.
Super-obese adolescents (with an average body mass index of 53)
undergoing bariatric surgery have enjoyed the same success,8
maintaining a ninety-pound weight loss over three years. High blood
pressure resolved in 74 percent of patients, and abnormal lipids in 66
percent of them. And type 2 diabetes? Glad you asked. A stunning 95
percent of type 2 diabetes was reversed: by trial’s end, these patients
had a median A1C of only 5.3 percent without medications. Once again,
this would classify these patients as nondiabetic.
That surgery can reverse type 2 diabetes has been known since
1992,9 when a study found that patients who had undergone bariatric
surgery achieved normal blood glucose within two months and
maintained it for ten years. The benefits extended far beyond their body
weight. Many of their metabolic abnormalities normalized as well. Sky-
high insulin levels plummeted to normal levels. Blood glucose dropped in
half. Fasting insulin, a marker of insulin resistance, dropped 73 percent.
What lesson can be learned from this? The problem was not that the
disease was chronic and progressive. The problem was that our
treatment didn’t really work. We had seen the great enemy, and it was
ourselves.
The startling success of bariatric surgery led to a 2016 joint statement
supported by forty-five diabetes organizations—including such influential
groups as the American Diabetes Association, the International Diabetes
Federation, and Diabetes UK—that surgery be recommended as a first-
line treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes and a body mass
index greater than 40, regardless of other lifestyle interventions.10 At a
body mass index between 35 and 40, they suggested, surgery should be
considered only if other lifestyle options failed. With this endorsement,
these groups have tacitly admitted that standard medications and lifestyle
treatments (low-fat, low-calorie diets) have failed to effectively treat this
disease.
WHY SURGERY IS NOT USUALLY THE RIGHT SOLUTION
DESPITE THE SUCCES of all these surgeries, I don’t generally recommend
them for a variety of reasons. Surgery carries a heavy price, both
financially and physiologically, due to many surgical complications. Most
importantly, though, we can derive all these amazing benefits without
surgery. We only need to understand why surgery succeeds where other
approaches fail, and how we can duplicate its results.
Many theories have tried to explain this. The foregut hypothesis
suggested that removing part of the healthy stomach is responsible for
the myriad of benefits. The stomach secretes many hormones, including
incretins, peptide YY, and ghrelin. Removing the stomach reduces all of
these hormones, and perhaps others not yet identified. However, it soon
became obvious that this explanation cannot possibly be correct.
The less-invasive gastric banding does not remove any part of the
stomach, but reverses type 2 diabetes as effectively as the Roux-En-Y
procedure in the short term. Indeed, the different bariatric procedures do
not differ substantially in their ability to reduce insulin resistance, despite
the wide variation in stomach removal or rerouting of the small intestines.
The only variable that matters is how much weight is lost.
The foregut hypothesis also failed to explain why type 2 diabetes
often recurs years later, since the stomach does not regenerate the ability
to secrete these hormones. This reasoning proves what should have
been a rather obvious point: that removing the healthy stomach doesn’t
truly have any benefits.
The “fat mass” hypothesis suggests that the loss of the fat tissue
leads to the beneficial effects. Adipocytes actively secrete many different
hormones, and perhaps one or several of these is the problem. For
example, adipocytes convert testosterone into estrogen, leading to the
familiar phenomenon of “man boobs” in obesity. So adipocytes are not
metabolically inert, but active hormonal players. This thinking presents
two problems: First, type 2 diabetes disappears within weeks of surgery,
long before any substantial loss of fatty mass. Second, liposuction
removes fat but fails to provide any metabolic benefit. It does not
significantly improve blood glucose readings or any measurable
metabolic markers. It offers only cosmetic benefits.11
There is no real magic here. The mechanism of benefit is the simplest
and most obvious. All bariatric surgeries are effective because they
create a sudden, severe caloric reduction. The simplest explanation is
often the correct one.
Remember that insulin resistance is an overflow phenomenon. Our
liver cells are jammed full of sugar and fat, like an overinflated balloon.
Insulin signals the cell to open up the gates to allow glucose inside. The
overflowing liver cells turn away the glucose, leaving it in the blood and
triggering the phenomenon known as insulin resistance. To decompress
the congested liver, newly created fat is exported to other organs,
clogging up the pancreas and leading to lowered insulin secretion.
With sudden, severe caloric restriction, our body depletes liver
glycogen stores in about twenty-four hours. Once that’s gone, we are
forced to burn fat for energy. The body burns the fat from the liver and
other organs preferentially, because it is more accessible than the fat
stored in the adipocytes.
Recall that this fat, contained within and around the abdominal
organs, causes metabolic syndrome. Therefore, removing this ectopic,
visceral fat reverses type 2 diabetes long before any substantial
reduction in overall fat mass becomes apparent. Diabetes reverses within
weeks of surgery, even though patients are still hundreds of pounds
overweight.
Removing fat from the organs leads to rapid metabolic improvement.
Removing excess fat from the pancreas resolves beta cell dysfunction.
As insulin secretion returns to normal, blood glucose begins to drop.
Removing the excess fat from the liver, like deflating that overinflated
balloon, reverses insulin resistance. The dual defects of type 2 diabetes
resolve.
What these surgical success stories show conclusively is that type 2
diabetes is a fully reversible disease. We have been led to believe that
type 2 diabetes progresses inevitably, like age. But this belief is simply
not true. Let’s juxtapose two facts:
•
Type 2 diabetes is a largely reversible disease.
•
With the standard treatments of low-calorie, reduced-fat diets and
medications (including insulin), type 2 diabetes progresses.
The only logical conclusion here, as bizarre as it may sound, is that
most cases of type 2 diabetes are being treated incorrectly. That is why
type 2 diabetes has become an epidemic. The problem is not the disease
but our treatment and understanding of it.
The reason that sudden, severe caloric restriction reverses type 2
diabetes is that it forces the body to burn the fat stored within the bloated
liver and pancreas cells. The body simply burns off the excess sugar and
fat that causes the type 2 diabetes and the disease goes into remission.
So is there another way to burn off all that ectopic fat without the cost and
complications of surgery? As it happens, there is. As Dr. Sarah Hallberg
and Dr. Osama Hamdy wrote in the New York Times, “Before you spend
$26,000 on weight loss surgery, do this.”12 What is the solution they’re
talking about? Simple. A low-carbohydrate diet.
CARBOHYDRATE-REDUCED
DIETS
If I had a flood in my house . . .
I would not spend day after day, week after week, & year after year
buying buckets, mops and towels. I would not be inventing different types
of buckets and more expensive mops or drainage systems to ensure the
water drained away quickly. I would find the source of the water and turn
it off!
DR. VERNER WHEELOCK
IN 2015, NEWSPAPERS reported that a three-year-old Texan girl had become
the world’s youngest person to develop type 2 diabetes.1 Yes, three
years old. At birth, she weighed 3.2 kg (7 pounds). At three-and-a-half
years old, she weighed 35 kg (77 pounds) and presented to the hospital
with the classic symptoms of diabetes: frequent urination and thirst.
Given her age, medical staff naturally assumed she had type 1
diabetes, the so-called early onset or juvenile diabetes. However, her
obesity suggested type 2 diabetes, and further testing confirmed it. There
was no family history of diabetes. Instead the problem was her diet,
which consisted mostly of candy, sugary drinks, and fast food. The
toddler was initially placed on medications. But with the proper diet, she
lost 25 percent of her original weight and was able to stop taking all her
medications as her blood glucose levels returned to normal. Two years
later, this little girl’s diabetes was cured.
Here’s another heart-warming story. My friend Betsy (not her real
name) was a twenty-seven-year-old medical researcher in a local
academic hospital. At her yearly checkup, she was overweight but
otherwise felt well. She was shocked to learn that screening blood tests
revealed a hemoglobin A1C of 10.4, which meant she had severe type 2
diabetes. Alarmed, her physician immediately prescribed three different
medications in line with the Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines.
Betsy was further warned that she would likely need medications for the
rest of her life and, eventually, insulin. She heard that type 2 diabetes is
chronic and progressive, a disease without hope of a cure.
Horrified, Betsy rejected this dire prediction and took none of the
medications. She did some research, started a very low-carbohydrate
diet called a ketogenic diet, and immediately noticed a difference. Her
weight dropped. Her waist size shrank. Three months later, her A1C level
was only 5.5 percent without any medications at all. She looked and felt
great. By definition, she no longer had type 2 diabetes. Again, Betsy’s
diabetes was cured. So much for a chronic and progressive disease!
In both cases, dietary changes addressed the root cause and
reversed the diabetes. That’s no surprise. All diabetes associations
throughout the world recommend starting treatment with diet and lifestyle
changes before prescribing medication. But what’s the best diet to follow
for type 2 diabetes? Unfortunately, that’s a more difficult question.
THE FAILURE OF THE LOW-FAT DIET
THE WORLD HEALTH Organization released its first Global Report on
Diabetes in 2016 but it only provides vague, general dietary guidelines for
treatment.2 It says that added sugars should be reduced to less than 10
percent of total calories but mentions nothing about optimal
macronutrient composition. There is no guidance to follow a low- or high-
carbohydrate, low- or high-fat, low- or high-protein diet. Similarly, the
American Diabetes Association 2016 standards of care document,
Diabetes Care,3 declined to recommend any particular diet. Both of these
organizations have quietly backed away from the ineffective low-fat,
calorie-restriction dietary advice they had promoted for forty years, tacitly
acknowledging its futility.
Fatty but delicious foods such as butter, full-fat cheese, and cream
were said to “clog arteries” and cause heart disease, so the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans in 1977 recommended that people eat 50 to 60
percent of their total daily calories as carbohydrates, in order to lower
dietary fat. Even as recently as 2008, the American Diabetes Association
position paper recommended a minimum daily carbohydrate intake of
130 grams.4 In North America, these carbohydrates tend to be highly
refined wheat and corn products such as sugar, bread, and pasta.
In 1999, at the height of the low-fat mania, the landmark Lyon Diet
Heart Study sent shockwaves through the medical community.5 Patients
who had suffered heart attacks were randomly assigned to the American
Heart Association’s low-fat diet or the high-fat Mediterranean diet, which
was full of olive oil, nuts, and avocados. The results were almost
unbelievable. The Mediterranean diet reduced heart disease and death
by a jaw-dropping 75 percent. It should hardly have come as a surprise,
as it confirmed what used to be called the French paradox.
In the 1980s and 1990s, people in France were eating saturated fat
like it was going out of style, yet their death rate from cardiovascular
disease was less than half what it was in the U.S. If saturated fat clogged
arteries and led inexorably to heart disease, then how could the French
possibly eat more fat and have less heart disease? The answer, in
hindsight, is pretty obvious. Eating saturated fat does not lead to
cardiovascular disease.6
The cardiovascular benefits of the relatively high-fat Mediterranean
diet have since been replicated many times. Most recently, the 2013
PREDIMED study confirmed that patients on the Mediterranean diet
reduced their rate of heart disease and death.7 Further comparison of
different dietary habits in the countries of Europe in 2012 shows that
higher saturated fat intake is associated with less heart disease.8 A 2009
meta-analysis9 demonstrated that saturated fat had no correlation to
heart disease and offers slight protection against stroke. In Japan, this
protection against stroke has also been noted.10 Slowly but steadily, the
realization that diets high in natural fats are intrinsically healthy is gaining
ground.
Figure 14.1. Higher dietary fat = lower risk of stroke and heart attack11
WHY TO EAT HEALTHY FAT
THE NUTRITIONAL LANDSCAPE began to change in the mid-2000s, as foods
high in monounsaturated fats began to be recommended for heart health.
Avocados, once regarded as dangerous due to their high fat content, are
now highly valued as a healthy superfood. Similarly, eating more nuts is
routinely linked to better health outcomes. Daily nut consumption is
associated with a 35 percent decreased risk of heart attack.12
Fatty cold-water fish, which are rich in omega-3 oil, are also
considered extremely protective against heart disease. Northern
communities where native people have eaten a traditional diet full of
whale and seal blubber as well as fatty fish have had virtually no
cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes.13 The town of Upernavik,
Greenland, for example, reported only a single case of type 2 diabetes
between 1950 and 1974; in comparison, about 13 percent of Americans
currently suffer from this disease.
High blood levels of trans-palmitoleic acid from full-fat dairy are
associated with a 60 percent reduction in the incidence of type 2
diabetes. It also improves HDL triglyceride levels and lowers markers of
inflammation, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.14 Egg yolks,
once reviled as being high in cholesterol, have been vindicated. Studies
now conclude that eating eggs, even daily, does not raise the risk of heart
disease.15 In fact, consuming lots of eggs reduces the risk of diabetes by
42 percent.16
Why is fat useful in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes?
Remember that of the three macronutrients, dietary fat stimulates insulin
the least. Pure fats, such as butter and olive oil, stimulate almost no
insulin release. Therefore, replacing refined carbohydrates with natural
fats is a simple, natural method of reducing insulin.17
WHY TO REDUCE REFINED CARBOHYDRATES
IN 2001, in a critical review of dietary fat and cardiovascular disease, Dr.
Walter Willett of Harvard’s School of Public Health noted that, “It is now
increasingly recognized that the low-fat campaign has been based on
little scientific evidence and may have caused unintended health
consequences.”18 Furthermore, as shown by Figure 14.2 from the
Nurses’ Health Study, a very large, long-term observational study from
Harvard University, he found a clear correlation between high glycemic
load in the diet and the risk of heart disease.19
Sugar and refined carbohydrates have a high glycemic load, which
raises blood glucose and the risk of type 2 diabetes. This, in turn,
significantly increases the risk of heart disease.
Figure 14.2. Higher glycemic load = higher risk of heart disease20
A comprehensive 2013 review concluded that certain diets provide
superior glycemic control.21 Specifically, four were found beneficial: the
low-carbohydrate diet, low glycemic-index diet, Mediterranean diet, and
high-protein diet. All four diets share a common trait: they reduce dietary
carbohydrates to varying degrees. Low-carbohydrate diets have proven
more effective at reducing body weight, waist size, and blood glucose.22
Figure 14.3. U.S. Macronutrient Consumption 1965–201123
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that between
1965 and 2000, as the twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes unfolded, Americans
primarily ate more carbohydrates and less dietary fat as a percentage of diet, just as the dietary
guidelines recommended.24
Refined grains and sugars are the main sources of carbohydrates,
and any low-carbohydrate diet should restrict these. Yet we need to make
a further distinction between unrefined carbohydrates, such as potatoes
and fruit, and refined carbohydrates, such as added sugars and flour,
because the higher the intake of refined carbohydrates, the higher the
risk of diabetes.25 The reason is that refined carbohydrates increase
blood glucose higher and faster than unrefined ones. This effect
becomes obvious when looking at glycemic load. Unrefined foods score
low on the scale despite having similar amounts of dietary carbohydrates.
Figure 14.4. Glycemic load of various carbohydrates26
This distinction explains how many traditional societies can eat
carbohydrate-based diets without evidence of disease. For example, the
Tukisenta, a highland tribe of New Guinea, derive 94.6 percent of their
energy intake as whole, unprocessed carbohydrates; and the Okinawans,
a group living on a small island in southern Japan, eat a traditional diet
that is almost 85 percent starch. Both groups eat mostly sweet potatoes.
With virtually no sugar or refined grains such as flour,27 type 2 diabetes is
almost non-existent. The native diet of Kitava, a small island off New
Guinea, consists of 69 percent carbohydrates, mostly tubers (sweet
potato, cassava, and yam), coconut, and fruit, but their average insulin
level is lower than 90 percent of Swedes.28
In other words, higher carbohydrate intake alone does not necessarily
lead to higher insulin levels. Refining and processing plays a leading role
in enhancing the insulin effect. Removing the natural fiber, fat, and
proteins in foods leaves pure concentrated carbohydrates, a form not
found naturally. Further grinding of these carbohydrates into a fine
powder (such as flour) increases the speed of digestion, which results in
higher blood glucose spikes. At the same time, we tend to eat more
refined carbohydrates because the satiating effect of the protein, fiber,
and fat have been lost. Fructose plays a dominant role in the
development of fatty liver, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, and
traditional societies eat little or no added sugar.
The essential defect of type 2 diabetes is hyperinsulinemia, which
may or may not be the result of too many carbohydrates. Reversing or
preventing type 2 diabetes means lowering insulin, and even diets high in
carbohydrates may do that. However, avoiding sugar and refined
carbohydrates remains the cornerstone of success. Studies prove that a
reduced-carbohydrate, higher-fat Mediterranean diet using olive oil
reduces the need for medication by a stunning 59 percent.29 By
recognizing the potential benefits of eating natural fats and reducing the
amount of added sugars and processed, refined carbohydrates, we are
on our way to reducing and reversing type 2 diabetes.
GET RID OF SUGAR—GET RID OF DIABETES
WE KNOW THAT the very essence of type 2 diabetes is too much sugar in
the body, not just in the blood. Once we understand this basic paradigm,
the solution is immediately obvious. If the problem is too much sugar
(glucose and fructose), two treatments will work. And luckily, neither
involves surgery or medications:
1. Stop putting sugar in (low-carbohydrate diets, intermittent fasting).
2. Burn remaining sugar off (intermittent fasting).
In short, a natural, drug-free solution to type 2 diabetes now lies within
our grasp.
Diets that eliminate sugar short-circuit the vicious cycle of too much
glucose leading to insulin resistance, insulin toxicity, and disease.
Remember, eating triggers insulin, but different macronutrients require
different amounts of insulin. Fat breaks down into fatty acids, which don’t
need insulin to properly metabolize. Protein breaks down into amino
acids, which need a little insulin to allow them to be processed by the
liver. Carbohydrates are the big insulin hogs. They break down into
glucose, which requires insulin to get into the cells. Fructose, found in
sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, directly causes insulin resistance,
which leads back to hyperinsulinemia. Due to its unique metabolic
pathway, fructose is many times more likely to cause insulin resistance
than glucose.
There are many reasons to recommend a diet low in carbohydrates
for type 2 diabetes.30 Don’t just take my word for it; low-carbohydrate
diets have been practiced in various forms for centuries, dating back to
the writings of William Banting in 1863.31 Doctors all over the world are
slowly recognizing the profound power of dietary change to influence the
treatment of diabetes.
I asked Dr. David Unwin, the winner of the United Kingdom’s
prestigious National Health Service Innovator of the Year Award in 2016,
to contribute a section to this book. He emailed me the following
description of his experience working as a family doctor in Northern
England:
I had an emergency call from the lab about a “sky-high” blood glucose result. I rushed over
to [my patient’s] house and found her just about to have lunch, spoon in hand over two large
bowls, one of vanilla ice cream and the second of rice pudding with a packet of chocolate
buttons. I gave her a stark choice: either eat less sugar or start lifelong insulin. Within a
week of choosing a better diet, her blood sugar settled into a normal range. Her case looks
rather obvious, but I wonder if our choices are always as apparent?
For the first two-thirds of my career as a doctor, I was ignorant of the truly amazing
power of simply severely cutting back on sugar. It was, in truth, my patients that taught me
this crucial lesson. One decided to give up dietary sugar and quickly proceeded to lose 23
kg. She normalised her blood glucose and blood pressure, and no longer required four
different “lifelong” medications. Years later, now aged 70, she is healthy, strong, and rides
everywhere on her bicycle. Strange, I thought. I had been telling everybody about the
chronic, progressive nature of diabetes as I ramped up the medications.
Another patient just stopped her diabetes medication. Worried, I called her. She had lost
so much weight, and looked so young that I thought it was the wrong patient. She started
eating a low-carbohydrate diet where not just sugar but all sources of glucose are greatly
reduced. Blood tests confirmed her diabetes was into full remission.
A week later, an article in the British Medical Journal caught my eye. Bread raised blood
glucose more than table sugar. Disbelieving, I found to my utter amazement—it’s a fact!
Starchy foods like bread, cereals, rice, or potato are “concentrated” sugar, digested into
huge amounts of glucose. The Glycaemic Index predicts how various carbohydrate-
containing foods will affect blood glucose. Changing the scale into equivalents of teaspoons
of sugar led to some surprising results. (Note: This is for illustrative purposes only. Foods
listed are not identical to sugar since sugar contains both fructose and glucose.)
Figure 14.5. How foods affect blood glucose: A comparison32
Armed with this new knowledge, I started to treat all motivated diabetic patients in my
practice with a low-carbohydrate diet. So far after four years, 160 patients have tried it, with
amazing results:
• Average weight loss of 9 kg.
• Average improvement in HbA1c of 18mmol/mol in type 2 diabetes.
Rather than giving patients advice, we gave information, and then asked patients if they
were ready for change. The new diagnosis of diabetes is a strategic opportunity to offer
dietary therapy as an alternative to lifelong medication. The point of initiating insulin is
another such occasion. Given the choice and the information, not a single patient has
chosen lifelong meds over dietary therapy in my GP practice. This has not only brought
better patient health, but led to substantial savings, too. We now save over £50,000 each
year on diabetes drugs compared to the U.K. average! Better health for less money.
In 2016, we collaborated with the clever folks at Diabetes.co.uk to produce a free on-line
educational module. It offered fairly commonsense advice:
• Replace carbs with green vegetables and pulses [legumes].
• Enjoy olive oil, nuts, and other healthy saturated fats.
• Avoid added sugar.
In its first year 170,000 people have used it, in a backlash against official dietary advice
by the National Health Service. After adopting this low-carbohydrate approach, patients lost
an average of 8 kg. Over 70 percent of patients experienced improved blood glucose levels
and an incredible 1 in 5 patients no longer required diabetic medication. Incredibly, these
benefits were delivered entirely free in only ten weeks!33
Dr. Osama Hamdy, the medical director of the Obesity Clinical
Program at Harvard University’s world famous Joslin Diabetes Center,
has been prescribing low-carbohydrate diets extensively in the treatment
of type 2 diabetes since 2005.34 He writes, “It is clear that we made a
major mistake in recommending the increase of carbohydrate loads.”
Increasing refined dietary carbohydrates naturally raises blood glucose in
a situation where blood glucose is already toxically high. Dr. Elliott Joslin
himself successfully treated so-called fatty diabetes (type 2 diabetes) with
a diet that contained only 2 percent carbohydrates.
For more than a decade, guidelines from the Joslin Center’s weight
management program have advised clients to reduce their intake of
refined carbohydrates to less than 40 percent of total calories. The
result? Clients have lost more than 10,000 pounds of weight, improved
their diabetes, and reduced their medications.
THREE RULES FOR REVERSING TYPE 2 DIABETES
ONCE WE UNDERSTAND how type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance develop,
we can implement strategies that carry a reasonable chance of reversing
it. Here are my top three food “rules” for reducing blood glucose, reducing
insulin, and reversing type 2 diabetes.
Rule#1: Avoid fructose
THE MOST IMPORTANT rule, without exception, is to eliminate all added
sugars from your diet. Recall that insulin resistance is the result of fatty
liver becoming overfilled and unable to accept more glucose. The most
important determinant of fatty liver is not just carbohydrates, but the
fructose contained in sucrose (table sugar) and high-fructose corn syrup.
Figure 14.6. The top dietary sources of fructose35
Remember that every single cell in the body can help disperse
glucose, but the liver is the only organ that can metabolize fructose.
Thus, fructose is many times more likely to cause fatty liver than glucose.
Since sucrose is composed of equal amounts of glucose and fructose, it
is the primary cause of fatty liver, bar none. Pure fructose is not
commonly available, but may be found in some processed foods.
Some obvious foods to eliminate are sugar-sweetened beverages,
including sodas, iced tea, sports drinks, mixed alcoholic drinks, juices,
smoothies, coffee drinks, and “enhanced” water. These liquids are loaded
with sugar. Cookies, cakes, desserts, muffins, cupcakes, and ice cream
are other obvious sources.
Virtually all processed foods contain added sugars for the simple
reason that they enhance flavor and texture at virtually no cost. Check
the labels on meat products, where sugar is often added to the sauce or
during processing. Sugar is often hidden in condiments (ketchup, relish),
spaghetti/tomato sauces, flavored yogurts, salad dressings, barbecue
sauces, applesauce, and spice mixes. Cereals and granola bars are
usually very high in sugar too. And ask about your restaurant meals;
sugar is often included in savory dishes because it’s a cheap way to
make all foods taste better.
What about fruit? The truth is there is no chemical difference between
the fructose contained naturally in fruit and the fructose contained within
sucrose. As with anything, the dose makes the poison. My best advice is
to avoid eating excessive amounts of fruit, especially as many modern
varieties are now available year-round and have been bred to be sweeter
than in the past. Dried fruits are usually high in sugar, so you’re probably
best to avoid raisins, dried cranberries, fruit leathers, and the like.
What about artificial sweeteners? I advise patients to avoid all
sweeteners, whether they contain calories or not. The logic is simple. If
non-caloric sweeteners could truly reduce diabetes and obesity, then we
would not have an epidemic on our hands. We have used these
chemicals extensively in our food supply for decades and the empirical
evidence is clear: artificial sweeteners are no better than sugar. Avoid
them all.
Rule#2: Reduce refined carbohydrates and enjoy natural fats
HYPERINSULINEMIA AND FATTY liver are the key problems leading to the
development of the metabolic syndrome, including obesity. Since refined
carbohydrates, of all the food groups, cause the highest rise in insulin
levels, it makes sense to eat less of them. Most processed products
made with wheat, corn, rice, and potatoes belong in this group.
Reduce or avoid refined wheat products such as bread, pasta,
waffles, muffins, cupcakes, and donuts. Limit processed corn products,
such as popcorn, corn chips, and tortillas, and refined potato products,
particularly french fries and potato chips. And eat white rice, which is also
a refined carbohydrate, in small amounts. High-fructose corn syrup
contains 55 percent fructose, which means it’s sugar, not corn. It’s found
in many processed food products and should be avoided.
Remember that carbohydrates are not intrinsically bad foods. Many
traditional societies ate diets heavy in carbohydrates and thrived. The
refining process is the major problem. Removing the natural fats and
protein and leaving behind a pure carbohydrate is not natural, and our
bodies have not evolved to handle that change. Even many wholewheat
and whole-grain products are highly refined. The key is the insulin
response to these foods, and whole, unrefined carbohydrates do not
cause nearly the insulin response that white flour does.
Replace those refined carbohydrates with fatty fish, olive oil,
avocados, and nuts. The natural saturated fats found in beef, pork,
bacon, butter, cream, and coconuts are also healthy fats. Eggs are an
excellent choice, as are most seafoods.
However, not all fats are benign. The industrially processed, highly
refined seed oils that are high in omega-6 fat are not recommended
because they can cause inflammation and adversely affect human
health. These oils include sunflower, corn, canola, safflower, and
vegetable oils. In particular, do not use these vegetable oils at high heat
because they release harmful chemicals called aldehydes when heated.
Stay away from deep-fried foods and all hydrogenated (trans) fats.
The diet I recommend has been called a low-carbohydrate, healthy-fat
(LCHF) diet. It is designed to keep blood glucose low, decrease insulin,
and therefore burn more fat. The result? Weight loss and an
improvement in diabetes.
Rule#3: Eat real food
AS I’VE SAID, there are good fats and bad fats. There are good
carbohydrates and bad carbohydrates. What is the key distinguishing
factor? Refining and processing.
Our bodies have had millennia to adapt to foods in their natural state.
So some traditional societies, such as people living in the Far North, may
eat an almost pure meat diet. And others, such as people living on the
Japanese island of Okinawa, can eat a high-carbohydrate diet. Because
these foods are not refined or processed, and because they contain little
or no sugar, neither group has traditionally had trouble with high blood
glucose, obesity, or type 2 diabetes. When traditional societies eating
traditional diets begin to eat highly processed foods and sugar, however,
obesity and type 2 diabetes follow closely behind.36
After all, you don’t pick dinner rolls from the tree. You don’t grow a
bottle of vegetable oil. The most important rule of all is to just eat real
food. If the food you are eating looks like it does when you see it in
nature, it is probably good for you.
A FOURTH RULE, IN CASE THE FIRST THREE AREN’T ENOUGH
CERTAINLY, AVOIDING FRUCTOSE, eating a LCHF diet, and consuming real food
is a great start, but these are often not enough to stop or reverse severe
type 2 diabetes. The disease can take decades to develop, and so the
vicious cycle of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance can continue
despite following all of the dietary rules. What if these simple dietary
changes are not enough?
Like many solutions, the answer is not new. It’s the oldest dietary
intervention known to humans, its natural cleansing power has been
harnessed by virtually all religions in the world, it’s free, and it can be
done anywhere. What am I talking about? The power of fasting.
INTERMITTENT FASTING
Again we keep this solemn fast
A gift of faith from ages past
ASCRIBED TO GREGORY THE GREAT, C. 540–604
FASTING, THE VOLUNTARY abstinence from food, has been known to cure
diabetes for close to 100 years. Dr. Elliott Joslin, one of the most famous
diabetes specialists in history, wrote about his experiences with fasting in
1916. He believed it was so obvious that fasting was helpful that studies
would not even be necessary. For type 2 diabetes, it seems self-evident
that if you don’t eat, your blood glucose levels will drop and you will lose
weight. As you lose weight, your type 2 diabetes will reverse. So, what’s
wrong with that?
As we’ve seen, the focus on dietary therapies for diabetes shifted with
the momentous discovery of insulin. While insulin was indeed a
miraculous cure for type 1, it was no panacea for type 2 diabetes. Interest
in fasting disappeared as doctors focused on what would be their
treatment mantra for the next century: drugs, drugs, and more drugs.
When the American Diabetes Association says there is no cure for type 2
diabetes, what they mean is that there is no drug cure. However, these
are two entirely different statements.
We’ve long known that bariatric surgery can reverse type 2 diabetes
by inducing a sudden, severe caloric deficit, which drops insulin levels.
Simply put, bariatrics is surgically enforced fasting. A study directly
comparing the two approaches shows that fasting is actually better than
surgery at lowering weight and reducing blood glucose.1 Fasting
produced almost twice the weight loss of bariatric surgery.
Food rationing across Europe during World Wars I and II restricted all
foods, not specifically sugar. These austerity measures also acted like an
enforced fast and reduced calories suddenly and severely. During that
time, the mortality rate from diabetes dropped precipitously. Between the
wars, as people went back to their accustomed eating habits, mortality
returned to its usual high level. While food rationing is now a thing of the
past in most countries, the point is simply this: strictly reducing food
intake has the potential to entirely reverse type 2 diabetes. Once again,
this seems self-evident. As you lose weight, type 2 diabetes disappears.
But surgery or wartime rationing is not the only way to create this
sudden, severe caloric deprivation. We can simply stop eating. This is the
time-tested, ancient healing tradition of fasting.
Remember that at its very core, type 2 diabetes is simply too much
sugar in the body. Thus, reversal depends upon two things:
1. Stop putting sugar in.
2. Burn remaining sugar off.
A low-carbohydrate, healthy-fat diet reduces the incoming glucose
load but does little to burn it off. Exercise may help, but the impact of
compensation also limits its effectiveness. Further, exercise only benefits
the skeletal muscles and not the fatty liver that is the cornerstone of this
disease.
Intermittent fasting, though, can help simultaneously with both facets
of diabetes reversal. Quite simply, it is the most powerful natural therapy
available for type 2 diabetes. But can’t you simply reduce your daily
calorie intake to get the same effect? It sounds good, but the simple
answer is no. Continuous mild calorie restriction is not at all the same as
intermittent, severe restriction. Let me explain.
INTERMITTENT FASTING VERSUS CONTINUOUS CALORIC REDUCTION
DEATH VALLEY, CALIFORNIA, has an average temperature of 77 degrees
Fahrenheit (25°C). Sounds perfect, doesn’t it? Yet most residents would
hardly call the temperature idyllic. Summer days are scorching hot and
winter nights are uncomfortably cold.
Consider that jumping off a foot-high wall a thousand times is far
different than jumping off a thousand-foot-high wall once. The difference
between the two is literally the difference between life and death.
Would you prefer to experience seven gray, drizzling days with an
inch of rain each, or six sunny, gorgeous days followed by a day of heavy
thundershowers with 7 inches of rain?
The point, as Figure 15.1 shows, is that averages don’t tell the whole
story.
Figure 15.1. Averages don’t tell the whole story
In all these examples, it’s obvious that averages represent only one
facet of the story. The frequency of the event is of paramount importance.
So why would we assume that reducing 300 calories per day over seven
days is the same as reducing 2100 calories over a single day? Constant
caloric restriction is not the same as intermittent fasting. Each scenario
provokes profoundly different hormonal responses in our body. The
difference between the two is literally the difference between success
and failure.
The portion-control strategy of constant caloric reduction is the most
common dietary approach recommended to treat both weight loss and
type 2 diabetes. For example, the American Diabetes Association’s main
dietary recommendation is “focus on diet, physical activity, and
behavioral strategies to achieve a 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit.”2 It
further advises patients to spread this reduction consistently throughout
the day rather than all at once, and dieticians following this approach
often counsel patients to eat four, five, or six times a day. In support of
this reduction strategy, calorie labels are everywhere—on restaurant
meals, packaged foods, and beverages. And if that’s not enough, there
are charts, apps, and hundreds of books to help us count calories. Even
with all these aids, successful weight loss using this approach is as rare
as humility in a grizzly bear.
After all, who hasn’t tried the portion-control strategy? Does it work?
Just about never. Data from the United Kingdom indicate that
conventional advice succeeds in only 1 in 210 obese men and 1 in 124
obese women.3 That is a failure rate of 99.5 percent, and that number is
even worse for morbid obesity. So whatever else you may believe,
portion control does not work. This is an empirically proven fact. Worse, it
has also been proven in the bitter tears of a million believers.
But why doesn’t it work? Because restricting calories causes a
compensatory increase in hunger and a decrease in the body’s metabolic
rate. This effect derails weight-loss efforts and ultimately ends in failure.
Intermittent fasting succeeds because it produces beneficial hormonal
changes that chronic caloric deprivation does not. Most importantly, it
reduces insulin and insulin resistance.
Remember the boy who cried wolf? Not crying wolf for a while will
make the villagers listen. Crying wolf constantly but a little softer does not
work. Resistance depends not only upon high insulin levels but also upon
the persistence of those elevated levels. Intermittent fasting prevents the
development of insulin resistance by creating extended periods of low
insulin that maintain the body’s sensitivity to insulin. This is the key to
reversing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.
Studies have directly compared daily caloric restriction with
intermittent fasting, while keeping the weekly calorie intake similar.4
Subjects ate a Mediterranean-style diet that included 30 percent fat, but
some restricted a portion of their calories every day whereas others
severely restricted their calories only two days a week and ate the full
diet the rest of the time. That is, the groups differed only in how often
they ate, but not in how many total weekly calories they consumed or the
types of food they ate.
Over six months, the two groups showed no difference in the amount
of weight and body fat loss between them, but an important difference
between their insulin and insulin sensitivity levels. Remember, in the
longer term insulin levels are the key driver of insulin resistance and
obesity.
Those on a daily calorie-restricted diet saw their insulin levels drop
but quickly reach a plateau. The intermittent fasting group, on the other
hand, continued to reduce their fasting insulin levels, a key marker of
improved insulin resistance, despite similar total caloric intake. Since type
2 diabetes is a disease of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, the
intermittent fasting strategy succeeded where caloric restriction did not. It
was the intermittency of the diet that made it effective.
A recent thirty-two-week trial compared the portion-control strategy
directly with intermittent fasting in obese adults.6 The caloric reduction
strategy was designed to subtract 400 calories per day from the
estimated energy requirements of participants. The fasting group ate
normally on eating days, but ate zero calories every other day.
Figure 15.2. The impact of fasting on insulin resistance5
The most important conclusion was that fasting was a safe and
effective therapy that anybody could reasonably follow. The fasting group
not only lost more weight, but also almost twice as much of the more
dangerous visceral fat. The portion-control group lost lean mass in
addition to fat, but the fasting group did not. Lean mass percentage
increased by 2.2 percent with fasting compared to only 0.5 percent with
portion control. In other words, fasting is four times better at preserving
lean mass. (So much for that old “fasting burns the muscle” myth.)
So why isn’t fasting more popular, despite its proven success? One of
the biggest deterrents is the starvation myth.
OVERCOMING THE STARVATION MYTH
The Biggest Loser is a long-running American TV reality show that pits
obese contestants against one another in a bid to lose the most weight.
The weight-loss regimen has two components: a calorie-restricted diet
calculated to be approximately 70 percent of each contestant’s energy
requirements, typically 1200 to 1500 calories per day, combined with an
intensive exercise regimen that is typically far in excess of two hours a
day.7
This is the classic “Eat Less, Move More” approach endorsed by all
the nutritional authorities, which is why The Biggest Loser diet scores
well on the 2015 U.S. News & World Report ranking of best fast weight-
loss diets.8 And it does work—but only in the short term. When studied,
average weight loss was 127 pounds over six months. That’s amazing.
Over the long-term, season two contestant Suzanne Mendonca said it
best when she stated there is never a reunion show because “We’re all
fat again.”9
These contestants’ basal metabolic rates—the energy needed to keep
the heart pumping, the lungs breathing, the brain thinking, the kidneys
detoxing, and so on—dropped like a piano out of a twenty-story building.
Over six months, their basal metabolism dropped by an average of 789
calories. Simply stated, they were burning 789 calories less each and
every day. That’s an almost insurmountable hurdle to continued weight
loss.
As metabolism drops, weight loss plateaus. Chronic caloric reduction
forces the body to shut down in order to match the lowered caloric intake.
This compensation is sometimes called “starvation mode.” Once
expenditure drops below intake, the even more familiar weight regain
begins. Goodbye reunion show. Even after six years, the metabolic rate
does not recover.10
But this is not exactly news. This metabolic slowdown in response to
caloric restriction has been scientifically proven for over fifty years. In the
1950s, Dr. Ancel Keys’s famous Minnesota Starvation Experiment11
placed volunteers on a diet of 1500 calories per day. Despite the study’s
name, this diet restricted calories by 30 percent over the subjects’ usual
diets—a degree of calorie restriction not dissimilar to many weight-loss
diets recommended today. In response, the subjects’ basal metabolic rate
dropped about 30 percent. They felt cold, tired, and hungry. When they
resumed their typical diet, all their weight came right back. Reversing
type 2 diabetes relies upon burning off the body’s excess glucose, so the
daily calorie-restricted diet will not work.
The secret to long-term weight loss is to maintain your basal
metabolism. So what doesn’t put you into starvation mode? Actual
starvation! Or at least the controlled version: intermittent fasting. Fasting
triggers numerous hormonal adaptations that do not happen with simple
caloric reduction. Insulin drops sharply, preventing insulin resistance.
Noradrenaline rises, keeping metabolism high. Growth hormone rises,
maintaining lean mass.
Controlled experiments prove this point. Over four days of continuous
fasting, basal metabolism (measured as resting energy expenditure, REE)
does not drop. Instead, it increases by 12 percent. The VO2, another
measure of basal metabolism that tracks the amount of oxygen used per
minute, similarly rises.12 Many other studies have confirmed these
findings. Twenty-two days of alternate daily fasting also did not result in
any decrease in basal metabolic rate.13
Figure 15.3. Metabolic changes over four days of fasting14
Remember the portion-control versus fasting study in the previous
section? The portion-control strategy dropped basal metabolism by 76
calories per day. By contrast, fasting was not associated with any
statistically significant drop in energy expenditure. In other words, daily
caloric reduction causes starvation mode where fasting does not.
The study concluded: “Importantly, ADF (Alternate Daily Fasting) was
not associated with an increased risk for weight regain.” The importance
of this statement will not be lost on anybody who has ever tried to lose
weight. You can lose weight on virtually any diet, but maintaining this
weight loss is the real battle.
Fasting works because it keeps basal metabolism high. Why? It’s a
survival mechanism. Imagine you are a cave dweller in the Stone Age.
It’s winter and food is scarce. If your body goes into starvation mode, you
will not have the energy to go out and find food. Each day the situation
will get worse and eventually you will die. The human species would have
become extinct long ago if our bodies slowed down every time we didn’t
eat for a few hours.
During fasting, the body opens up its ample supply of stored food—
body fat. Basal metabolism stays high, and instead of using food as our
fuel, we use food our bodies have stored as body fat. After all, that’s
exactly why we stored it in the first place. Now we have enough energy to
go out and hunt some woolly mammoth.
During fasting, we first burn glycogen stored in the liver. When that is
finished, we use body fat. Oh hey, good news: there’s plenty of fat stored
here. Burn, baby, burn. And since there is plenty of fuel, there is no
reason for basal metabolism to drop. That’s the difference between long-
term weight loss and a lifetime of despair. That’s the knife edge between
success and failure. Simply put, fasting provides beneficial hormonal
changes that are entirely prevented by the constant intake of food, even
when the calories in that food are reduced. It is the intermittency of the
fasting that makes it so much more effective.
If we want our bodies to burn off the sugar that is causing type 2
diabetes, we need the fire of our basal metabolism to remain stoked. We
can forge our new diabetes-free bodies in the crucible of fasting.
FASTING OR REDUCING CARBS: WHICH IS BETTER?
BOTH INTERMITTENT FASTING and low-carbohydrate, healthy-fat (LCHF) diets
effectively reduce insulin, and thus can cause weight loss and reverse
type 2 diabetes. Fasting lowers insulin maximally, so it is quite simply the
quickest and most efficient method. Still, the very low–carbohydrate diet
does remarkably well, giving you 71 percent of the benefits of the fasting
without actual fasting.15 Compared to the standard 55 percent
carbohydrate diet, low-carbohydrate diets reduce insulin by roughly half,
despite similar calorie intakes. Fasting reduces that by another 50
percent. That’s power.
Notably, these studies demonstrate that the benefits of carbohydrate
restriction on blood glucose were not simply due to calorie restriction.
This is useful knowledge, considering how many health professionals
keep parroting that “It’s all about the calories.” Actually, it’s not. If it were
true, then a plate of brownies would be as fattening, and as likely to
cause type 2 diabetes, as a kale salad with grilled salmon and olive oil,
as long as the calories were equal. But this notion is clearly ridiculous.
The more we eat ultra-processed, insulin-stimulating food, the more
we need to fast to bring those insulin levels back down. And nothing
beats fasting for bringing down insulin. But should we fast or follow a LCHF
diet? It’s not a question of either/or. We can incorporate both fasting and
a LCHF diet for maximal benefits.
If dietary interventions reduce both blood glucose and insulin for type
2 diabetes, why do we need medications at all? We don’t. Type 2
diabetes is a dietary disease, and fixing the diet will reverse the disease.
FASTING FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES
FASTING ALLOWS US to naturally empty the sugar from our body (the sugar
bowl). Once empty, any incoming sugar will no longer spill out into the
blood, and we will no longer meet the criteria for diabetes. We will have
reversed the disease.
As far back as 1916, Dr. Joslin reported the benefits of fasting for
diabetes. In the modern era, reports dating to 1969 confirm these
benefits. Thirteen obese patients were hospitalized to treat their weight
issues and were found incidentally to also have type 2 diabetes. They
fasted for seventeen to ninety-nine days and averaged a 43-pound
weight loss. Diabetes completely reversed, without exception.
Interestingly, this reversal did not depend upon weight loss,16 reflecting
yet again that it is not total fat loss that matters, but ectopic fat loss.
Certain general principles apply to fasting with type 2 diabetes. How
long it takes to reverse the disease depends on the intensity of the
fasting regimen and the length of time you’ve had the disease. More
intensive fasting will give quicker results, but if you have had type 2
diabetes for twenty years, it is unlikely to reverse in several months. It will
take longer, though the exact time differs from patient to patient.
Fasting when taking medications
IF YOU ARE taking medications, then you must speak with your physician
before starting a fast. Diabetic medications are prescribed based on your
current diet. If you change your diet without adjusting your medications,
then you risk triggering hypoglycemic reactions, which are extremely
dangerous. You may feel shaky, sweaty, or nauseated. In more severe
cases, you could lose consciousness or even die. Carefully monitoring
and adjusting your medications is essential.
Some diabetes drugs are more likely to cause hypoglycemia,
especially insulin and sulfonylureas. Metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, and
SGLT2 inhibitors have a lower risk of hypoglycemia, so these are
preferred. If you are taking medication for diabetes—and again, talk to
your physician first—it’s important to monitor your blood glucose
frequently with a standard home monitor. Check your blood sugar at least
twice a day and ideally up to four times a day on both fasting and non-
fasting days. If you are not taking medication, this is not necessary. Blood
glucose may drop slightly but should remain in the normal range.
Your physician can direct you on how to reduce or hold diabetic
medications, and especially insulin, during fasting days. They can be
taken on an as-needed basis when blood glucose goes too high.
Modestly elevated blood glucose is not often a problem, since it can be
expected to come down with fasting. In my Intensive Dietary
Management (IDM) program, for example, the target blood glucose is 8.0
to 10.0 mmol/L while fasting, if you are taking medication. This range is
higher than the non-fasting norm. Mildly elevated blood glucose levels
are not harmful in the short term, and this higher range creates a margin
of safety to prevent the far more dangerous hypoglycemic reactions. I
consider this to be an acceptable trade-off. The long-term goal is to
successfully reduce and then stop all medications and still be able to
maintain your sugars in the normal range.
If you are unsure whether to take medication or not, it is generally
better to use less medication during fasting. If blood glucose rises too
high, you can always take more medication to compensate. However, if
you overmedicate and hypoglycemia develops, you must eat some sugar
to treat it. That will break the fast and is counterproductive to reversing
the diabetes. Again, consult with your doctor for guidance.
Medications unrelated to diabetes can often be taken as usual during
fasting, though you must discuss them with your physician first. However,
certain medications are best taken with food to avoid side effects. When
taken on an empty stomach, metformin and iron supplements often
cause diarrhea and stomach upset. Magnesium supplements can cause
diarrhea. Aspirin may cause stomach pain and ulcers. Many aspirin
preparations are coated to prevent this side effect but it may still occur.
Choosing a fasting regimen
NO SINGLE FASTING regimen is correct. The key is to choose the one that
works best for you. Some people do well with an extended fast whereas
others have better results with shorter, more frequent, fasts. You may
need to try a few different fasting regimens to find the one that is most
effective for you.
In my Intensive Dietary Management program, we often start with a
thirty-six-hour fasting period three times per week for type 2 diabetes.
During the eating periods, we prescribe a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.
We provide strict medical supervision for patients, and frequent follow-up
visits are essential. After they begin, we adjust the fasting schedule for
each patient according to how they respond.
Some people will do a classic water-only fast, others a modified-fat
fast, and still others a bone broth fast. It is important to drink fluids to stay
hydrated and monitor yourself. If you feel ill at any point, you should stop
and seek professional advice. Regardless of the regimen you choose,
monitor your body weight, waist circumference, medications, and blood
glucose. If everything is moving in the right direction, continue with the
regimen. If your results stall or are getting worse, you must change the
dietary regimen. Talk with your doctor about other options.
Everybody reacts differently to fasting. Some patients with long-
standing diabetes completely reverse within several weeks. Others see
very slow progress even with intensive fasting. Just because you are not
getting the results you want does not necessarily mean you are doing it
incorrectly or fasting isn’t going to work for you. You may simply not have
found the optimal regimen for you.
Intensifying the duration or frequency of your fasting regimen may
improve the chances of getting results. Undertake shorter fasts more
often. Extend a longer fast. Often it is useful to do a longer fast on a
regular basis, say every three to six months. Or make your fast stricter,
say, by shifting from a bone broth fast to a water-only fast.
If you find fasting difficult, it can be useful to closely monitor your diet
and try to lower your dietary carbohydrates further.
What to expect when you start a fast: Dumping toxic load
ADJUSTING TO A fast can take a bit of time. It’s not unusual to get hunger
pains or headaches or even to experience muscle cramps or skin
irritations. These side effects are often signs that the body is dumping its
toxic sugar load. Often, they will lessen and go away over a few weeks,
but be sure to discuss them with your doctor. Another sign that the body
is getting rid of its excess sugar is the dawn phenomenon.
What to expect after a period of fasting: The dawn phenomenon
AFTER A PERIOD of fasting, and especially in the morning, some people
experience high blood glucose. This dawn phenomenon (DP), or dawn
effect, was first described about thirty years ago. The DP is created by the
circadian rhythm. Just before awakening (around 4 am), the body
secretes higher levels of adrenaline, growth hormone, glucagon, and
cortisol to prepare for the upcoming day. Adrenaline gives our body some
energy. Growth hormone helps repair and synthesize new protein.
Glucagon helps move glucose from storage into the blood so it’s ready to
use as energy. Cortisol, the stress hormone, gets us ready for activity.
After all, we are never quite so relaxed as in deep sleep. This normal
circadian hormonal surge tells the liver to start pushing out some glucose
and generally activates the body. It’s a good ol’ fashioned hormonal kick
in the ass, so to speak.
These hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner, peaking in the
early morning hours then falling to low levels during the day. In
nondiabetic situations where there is no need to manage blood glucose
artificially, the DP is a normal occurrence, but most people miss it
because the magnitude of the rise is very small.
In about 75 percent of type 2 diabetics, however, it shows up as a
noticeable spike in blood glucose levels early in the morning. The
severity varies widely and occurs whether patients are being treated with
insulin or not because the huge fatty liver wants desperately to deflate
itself. As soon as it gets the signal, sugar comes whooshing out of the
liver and into the blood. Like the overinflated balloon, the liver puts forth
prodigious amounts of sugar in order to relieve itself of this toxic sugar
burden. As an analogy, think about a time when you really, really needed
to urinate. You had drunk too much water and there was no bathroom
nearby. When the time finally came to pee, there was no stopping that
large, fast flow. That’s the dawn phenomenon.
The same phenomenon exists during extended fasts, which induce
the same hormonal changes as shorter overnight fasts. Insulin drops, so
the liver releases some of its stored sugar and fat. This is natural. In type
2 diabetes, all that sugar pent up inside the fatty liver whooshes out too
quickly and shows up, like an uninvited guest, as glucose in the blood.
Even if you have not eaten for a while, the body will still release its stored
sugar.
Is this a bad thing? No, not at all. We are merely moving the sugar
from storage in the liver, where we could not see it, into the blood where
it becomes visible. The dawn phenomenon, or higher blood glucose
during fasting, does not mean you are doing anything wrong. It’s a
normal occurrence. It just means that you have more work to do to burn
off all the stored sugar in the body.
If your blood glucose rises during fasting, ask yourself where that
glucose came from. The only possibility is that it came from your own
body. You are simply moving some stored food energy out from the body
and into the blood for you to use.
TOWARD A CURE: PREVENTION, TREATMENT, ERADICATION
IMAGINE A WORLD without obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic
syndrome. No more diabetic kidney disease. No more diabetic eye
disease. No more diabetic nerve damage. No more diabetic foot ulcers.
No more diabetic infections. Fewer heart attacks. Fewer strokes. Fewer
cancers. No more need for diabetic medications. Can we really dare to
dream? Yes, we can.
With a new, deeper understanding of type 2 diabetes and its effective
treatments, we can eradicate this disease. We can reverse type 2
diabetes, completely naturally, completely without cost, completely
without surgery—completely. Equally important, we can also now forestall
it.
The northern city of Da Qing in China’s Heilongjiang Province gained
national prominence as the site of China’s most productive oil field and
one of its richest cities. But, as emphasis shifts to cleaner energy, Da
Qing is becoming known globally for a completely separate reason: its
prevention of type 2 diabetes.
In 1986, the World Health Organization funded the China Da Qing
Diabetes Prevention Outcomes Study,17 a randomized, controlled trial of
577 Chinese adults with prediabetes. The main dietary intervention was
to increase intake of vegetables and reduce consumption of alcohol and
sugar. Counselors also encouraged lifestyle measures, including more
physical activity.
Active intervention over six years reduced the incidence of diabetes
by a stunning 43 percent, and this benefit was sustained over twenty
years. The onset of type 2 diabetes was delayed by an average of 3.6
years. The cardiovascular death rate fell from 20 percent to only 1
percent. Professor Nicholas Wareham of University of Cambridge
commented that the study was a “real breakthrough, showing that
lifestyle intervention can reduce the risk of long-term cardiovascular
consequences of diabetes.”18
Multiple studies of lifestyle interventions similar to ones in Da Qing
have shown exactly the same benefit. Although the dietary intervention
varies depending upon the study, most focus upon weight loss. In the
United States, the Diabetes Prevention Program reduced the incidence of
type 2 diabetes by 58 percent19 and sustained the benefits for ten
years.20 The Indian Diabetes Prevention Programme reduced the
incidence of type 2 diabetes by almost 30 percent.21 The Finnish
Diabetes Prevention Study reported a 58 percent reduction.22 A
Japanese trial reduced progression by 67 percent.23
All these successful trials shared one common factor of overriding
importance. They all used lifestyle interventions, not medications. So type
2 diabetes is not only a treatable disease, but a preventable one.
REVERSING AND PREVENTING TYPE 2 DIABETES NATURALLY: A BRAVE NEW WORLD
OBESITY, FATTY LIVER, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes are the
twenty-first-century equivalents of the Bubonic plague that killed an
estimated fifty million people in Asia, Europe, and Africa during the
fourteenth century. Despite advances in computer technology, genetic
engineering, and molecular biology, the problem only grows worse and
has now engulfed the entire world, reaching across all genetic
boundaries. It’s time to stop pretending type 2 diabetes is a chronic and
progressive disease, and it’s time to stop treating it that way. Clearly type
2 diabetes is a dietary and lifestyle disease. To pretend otherwise is pure
self-deception.
But here’s what is important. A dietary disease requires a dietary
treatment. And since weight gain clearly plays a prominent role in the
development of type 2 diabetes, weight loss must similarly play a large
role in its reversal. We know that bariatric surgery, very low-carbohydrate
diets, and fasting are well-known treatments for type 2 diabetes and they
are proven to cure. We also know that insulin, oral hypoglycemics, and
low-fat diets can lower blood glucose but do nothing to cure type 2
diabetes.
Figure 15.4. Dietary disease; dietary treatment
The treatments that cure all show one common characteristic. They
lower insulin. Since type 2 diabetes is a disease of hyperinsulinemia, it is
only logical that these treatments are beneficial. And what do all the
treatments that do not cure type 2 diabetes have in common? They raise
insulin. And in fact, using these treatments worsens diabetes over time.
Again, let’s juxtapose two incontrovertible facts:
Fact #1: Type 2 diabetes is a reversible disease.
Fact #2: Virtually all conventionally treated patients get worse.
Unfortunately, there is only one conclusion. The conventional
treatment recommended by virtually every doctor in the world is not
correct. This is terrific news! Why? Because it means we can change its
natural history. It means the doorway to a diabetes-free world has just
opened.
We can prevent and cure not just type 2 diabetes but the entire
metabolic syndrome completely and utterly with knowledge alone. Not
the latest and greatest invention, but the tried and true. The oldest
lifestyle interventions known to humans: a LCHF diet and intermittent
fasting. A world freed from the chains of type 2 diabetes awaits. Like
dreams waiting to be dreamt, a cure beckons. We need only to take
those first few, brave steps to cross the threshold. The journey toward
better health, free of obesity and type 2 diabetes, now begins.
ALBERTO
Alberto, 70, had a seventeen-year history of type 2 diabetes
and had been taking insulin in ever-increasing doses for nearly
ten of them. His A1C was 7.7% and he was on 160 units of
insulin a day, as well as sitagliptin. Alberto also had a history of
chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and sleep apnea.
When he entered the IDM program, Alberto started on a
low-carbohydrate, healthy-fat diet with 24 to 42 hours of
fasting, five days per week. Within a month, he completely
stopped all his medications, including insulin; his blood glucose
was better than ever, with his A1C at 7.3%. Just three months
into the program, Alberto has lost 24 pounds and is well on his
way to regaining his health.
LANA
Lana was just 18 years old when she was diagnosed with type
2 diabetes. For thirteen years, she took blood-glucose-lowering
medications. She began taking insulin as well when she
became pregnant at age 31. Even after her pregnancy, her
A1C was 7.2% and her doctor continued her on 82 units of
insulin a day in addition to metformin.
When Lana entered the IDM program, she started with a
seven-day fast. By the end of that week, her sugars had
normalized and she was able to stop taking all her
medications; she has not resumed them since. She then
settled into a routine of fasting for 42 hours, two to three times
per week. After a year on the program, Lana has lost 55
pounds, including 33 cm around her waist, and her A1C has
dropped to 6.1%.
AFTERWORD
DESPITE THE TITLE of this book and its in-depth exploration of type 2
diabetes, it may surprise you to learn that I do not truly consider this book
to be about diabetes. “What?” I can hear you protesting. “Almost every
word in this book discusses diabetes!” No, my friend, this book is truly
about hope.
I hope we can eradicate type 2 diabetes within a generation. I hope
we can erase all the diseases associated with metabolic syndrome. I
hope we can recover all the associated costs, both in dollars and human
suffering. I hope we can accomplish these goals without drugs and
without surgery, using only knowledge as our weapon.
HOW IT BEGAN: MY JOURNEY TO HOPE
IN A SENSE, this book parallels my own journey. I entered medical school at
the University of Toronto just after I turned nineteen. Once I finished
medical school, I trained conventionally in internal medicine and then I
spent two years completing my specialty training in kidney disease
(nephrology) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Since 2001,
I have practiced clinical nephrology in Toronto, which means that I have
now spent more than half of my life in the study of medicine. During my
entire education, I received virtually no training in nutrition and certainly
did not see it as my area of specialization.
As a kidney specialist, I know that type 2 diabetes is, by far, the
biggest cause of kidney disease. I have seen many patients with mild
forms of the disease and treated them exactly as I, as well as countless
other doctors, had been taught. I prescribed medications to keep their
blood glucose low. When that didn’t work, I prescribed insulin. When that
didn’t work, I kept right on increasing the dose. Every medical school and
medical association taught, and still teaches, that tight blood glucose
control was the key to managing type 2 diabetes.
After treating thousands of patients over decades, it gradually dawned
on me that none of these diabetes medications actually made any real
difference to the health of patients. Sure, the medical schools said these
drugs improved patient health, but any benefits were imperceptible.
Whether these patients took their medications or not, they still
progressed to more and more severe forms of disease. Their kidneys
failed. They had heart attacks. They got strokes. They went blind. They
needed amputations.
Once their kidneys failed, I would start them on dialysis. I have seen
more diabetic foot infections, diabetic ulcers, heart attacks, and strokes
than I can count. Even if they made a statistical difference, the medicines
I prescribed made no real clinical difference. I suspected that we only
thought these medicines made a difference because we were being told
they made a difference.
Clinical trial evidence finally caught up with real-world experience in
2008. That year, the results of the landmark randomized ACCORD and
ADVANCE studies were released, followed shortly by the ORIGIN and VADT
studies. Confirming perfectly my experience treating patients, the studies
proved conclusively that using blood glucose–lowering medications for
type 2 diabetes was useless.
Doctors like me were certainly prescribing a lot of medications, but
these drugs provided no protection against heart disease, stroke, death,
eye disease, or kidney disease. If anything, insulin seemed to make
things worse, not better. Now it was a proven fact. This core principle of
treating type 2 diabetes—taught in every medical school in the world—
had just been disproven.
The entire treatment paradigm of type 2 diabetes needed to change.
We had to incorporate this new hard-won knowledge to gain a newer,
more complete understanding. However, what happened next was
unfortunate, even if it was entirely predictable. Rather than developing
new paradigms of insulin resistance, which could lead to more effective
treatments, we clung to the old, failed paradigms because it is far easier
to ignore an inconvenient truth than to face it. So we kept on giving the
exact same medications, using the same treatments and getting the
same poor outcomes. Same old thinking, same old results. Insanity, as
Albert Einstein would have said. Patients continued to get sick and die.
Breaking paradigms is hard work. We were so intent on treating the
high blood glucose that we forgot to treat the diabetes. If losing weight
was the key to reversing diabetes, how could medications like insulin,
which causes weight gain, be beneficial? We made no serious attempts
to look for explanations. The reality was troublesome, so it was easier for
doctors and researchers to live in a pretend world where these
medications were the correct treatment for diabetes.
NEW PARADIGMS FOR OBESITY
WHILE DIABETES RESEARCHERS may not have been looking for alternatives,
new paradigms were forming in the field of obesity medicine. Interesting
studies were being published about the effectiveness and dangers of low-
carbohydrate diets. In the late 1990s, the low-carbohydrate Atkins-styled
diets enjoyed a huge surge of popularity. Health professionals like me
and most other physicians were aghast, positive that these high-fat
Atkins-styled diets would cause heart disease. A number of trials were
launched in the early 2000s to prove this precise point.
Then a funny thing happened, or rather didn’t happen: anything bad.
Those predictions that the high-fat diet would cause high cholesterol
levels and clog arteries were wrong. Actually, the opposite was true. Not
only did patients lose weight, their entire metabolic profile improved,
including their cholesterol levels. Trial after trial showed that these low-
carbohydrate, high-fat diets were safe and effective. A few years later, in
2006, the Women’s Health Initiative, the largest randomized dietary trial
ever done, proved beyond a doubt that low-fat diets did not protect
against heart disease, strokes, or cancer. Worse, the calorie restriction
also did not cause weight loss or reduce type 2 diabetes. The entire
foundation of modern nutritional advice was completely shattered.
The entire treatment paradigm of obesity needed to change. Yet once
again, physicians around the world continued to practice as if nothing had
changed. We clung to old, failed paradigms like a life raft. We continued
to preach a low-fat diet. We continued to advise people to “Eat Less and
Move More.” We got the same poor results, and patients continued to
become obese and get sick. Same old thinking, same old results. Yes,
insanity.
Not satisfied with these two deep paradoxes, I started to look for
answers starting from ground zero. I made no assumptions about what
caused obesity or type 2 diabetes. This was the most important step.
Breaking free of all the old assumptions allowed me to see, all of a
sudden, how certain facts, hidden in plain view, became obvious.
MY SEARCH FOR ANSWERS: ALWAYS START WITH “WHY”
THE QUESTION OF causality has always intrigued me. I like to understand
the mechanism of disease, the question of “why.” Obesity is no different.
“Why do people get fat?” I wondered. This question is absolutely critical
because without understanding how people get fat I could not understand
how to effectively treat the disease.
I had never really considered this important question, and it turns out
that virtually nobody else had either. We all thought we already knew the
answer. Too many calories cause obesity. If that were true, then reducing
calories should cause weight loss. Except it doesn’t. The failure rate of
caloric reduction diets was astronomically high. My search for the true
underlying cause led ultimately to my recognition that a hormonal
imbalance, predominantly of insulin, is the key to obesity. I detail this
process in my first book, The Obesity Code.
But this answer only led me to another paradox. If too much insulin
was causing obesity, then why would I, as a physician, prescribe insulin
to overweight type 2 diabetics? It would only make things worse. Insulin
was the problem, not the answer.
Interestingly, my patients already knew. “Doc,” they would say, “you’ve
always told me to lose weight but now you give me insulin, which has
made me put on 50 pounds. How is that good?” The answer was that it
was not good; it was absurd.
My next question, then, was “Why does type 2 diabetes develop?”
Again, always start with “why?” Everybody agreed that elevated insulin
resistance caused the high blood glucose that was the hallmark of type 2
diabetes. But what caused the elevated insulin resistance? This was the
true question that I desperately needed to answer.
The key insight came from understanding obesity. Too much insulin
causes obesity, so it is logical that too much insulin could also cause
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. That obesity and type 2 diabetes
were manifestations of the same disease, and simply flip sides to the
same coin, explained perfectly how these two diseases were so closely
related.
Albert Einstein once said, “When you have eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” If the problem
was too much insulin, then the answer was simplicity itself. Lower insulin.
But how? No drugs at the time effectively did that. The solution was to go
back to the basics. As a dietary disease, it required a dietary solution, not
a pharmaceutical one. Since refined carbohydrates stimulate insulin the
most and dietary fat the least, the obvious solution was to eat a low-
carbohydrate, high-fat diet.
INTENSIVE DIETARY MANAGEMENT: SPREAD THE WORD
IN 2011, I established the Intensive Dietary Management program in
Scarborough, Ontario, along with Megan Ramos, a medical researcher
long interested in this exact problem. Together, we counseled patients,
many with type 2 diabetes, on how to follow a low-carbohydrate, high-fat
diet. I believed and hoped they would improve their health.
The results were a disaster. Nobody lost weight. Nobody got better. A
review of my patients’ diet diaries revealed they were eating lots of bread,
noodles, and rice. They had misunderstood these foods as being part of
a low-carbohydrate diet. Having followed a low-fat diet for most of their
lives, this new regimen was entirely foreign to them, and they didn’t know
what to eat. I needed to find a simpler solution.
One day, a friend told me about her “cleanses,” and immediately I
rolled my eyes. Like most people, my gut reaction was that fasting would
never work. But what, really, was wrong with fasting? I was intrigued
enough to start investigating the medical literature, most of which was
decades old. The more I understood the physiology, the more I realized
there was simply no reason that fasting couldn’t be used successfully as
a therapeutic intervention. After all, it was the oldest and perhaps the
simplest solution. I started to guide patients through diet and fasting
regimes. This time, the results were completely different.
Some of the success stories were almost unbelievable. Patients who
had been taking high doses of insulin for decades would eliminate all
their medications in a matter of weeks. My patients lost significant weight
and kept it off. Interestingly, many patients reported that it was much,
much easier to follow the program than they had anticipated. They
expected their hunger would grow unimaginably intense, but the opposite
was true. As they continued fasting, their hungers and cravings often
dissipated like a morning fog. Some thought their stomach had shrunk.
They expected fasting would leave them weak and unable to
concentrate, but the opposite was true. Women who had barely had
enough energy to walk in the door would come running in. Their
husbands said they couldn’t keep up with them any longer.
As the pieces came together, I began lecturing to both patients and
physicians around Toronto. I posted my six-part lecture “The Aetiology of
Obesity” series on YouTube1 and started my blog, “Intensive Dietary
Management”2 to share my findings with the general public. One night, I
gave a lecture to a group of specialist physicians about obesity. After the
first hour-long lecture, they were so interested in the new paradigms that
I gave a second lecture. One of those physicians later contacted Rob
Sanders of Greystone Books, who asked me to write a book about
obesity and type 2 diabetes. Rob has been hugely supportive from the
beginning, for which I am very grateful.
There was too much material for a single book. To properly address
the misconceptions of obesity and type 2 diabetes and lay the foundation
for treatment, the book would have been 800 pages—intimidating just to
look at. The natural solution was to divide this material into two books.
The Obesity Code, published in 2016, set the stage for the deeper
understanding of type 2 diabetes in this book. Together, they enable
readers to naturally reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Every single day, I see patients whose type 2 diabetes is reversing,
patients who are losing weight and getting healthier. This is the reason I
became a doctor! I want to help people regain their health, and I want to
give people hope that they can indeed defeat obesity and type 2
diabetes, completely naturally. That’s perfect, because patients also do
not want to be sick or take medications. It’s a win-win situation.
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
TYPE 2 DIABETES is currently the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure,
amputations, heart attacks, strokes, and cancer. But it doesn’t have to be
our future. The pages of The Obesity Code and The Diabetes Code
contain the knowledge to reverse type 2 diabetes. This is not the end, but
only the beginning. A new hope arises. A new dawn breaks.
APPENDIX:
TWO SAMPLE WEEK-LONG
MEAL PLANS
EACH OF THESE meal plans, designed by my colleague Megan Ramos at
Intensive Dietary Management (www.IDMprogram.com), consists of three
30- to 36-hour fasts done on three alternate days of the week. During the
fasting period, you do not take any meals. You can consume fasting
fluids such as water, green tea, herbal tea, and coffee during this time.
In Sample 1, if you begin your 36-hour fast after dinner (7:30 p.m.) on
Sunday night, you would not eat again until breakfast on Tuesday
morning (7:30 a.m.). In other words, you will not consume breakfast,
lunch, dinner, or any snacks during your fasting days. On non-fasting
days, you can eat meals and snacks as usual.
In Sample 2, if you begin your 30-hour fast after lunch (12:30 p.m.) on
Sunday, you would not eat again until dinner (6:30 p.m.) on Monday
night. Again, you will not consume any food during your fasting period but
you are encouraged to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fasting fluids.
This schedule incorporates slightly shorter fasting periods, with the
advantage of eating at least one meal per day. If you are taking
medications that must be taken with food, this schedule may be useful.
The following meal plans provide two sample schedules for a 30- to
36-hour fasting regimen complemented by a low-carbohydrate, healthy-
fat diet. Remember to consult with your doctor before you begin this or
any new regimen. Sparkling or still water, green teas, or herbal teas are
excellent drinks to accompany these meals.

PREFACE
FREEING THE RUNNER WITHIN: YOUR CRUCIAL FIRST
STEP
BY T.J. MURPHY
 
 
NFL football players, elite military athletes, fighter pilots, San Francisco Ballet dancers, Tour de
France cyclists, world-class CrossFitters and powerlifters, and runners of all varieties—this is the
sort of range of athletes who have benefited from Dr. Kelly Starrett’s particular genius when it comes
to movement and mechanics.
 
Kelly’s own background is equally eclectic. He was a member of the USA Canoe and Kayak Team
and competed in two world championships with the Men’s Whitewater Rafting Team. His interests
are wide and far-ranging, from surfing to martial arts to skateboarding to Olympic lifting to so-you-
think-you-can-dancing.
In a way, Kelly’s journey to becoming an internationally renowned expert in movement began at the
end of his kayaking career. While putting in yet another hour of hard training—on top of the thousands
he had already logged—his neck and shoulder went into a human version of a computer crashing. He
couldn’t turn his head. His professional whitewater career was done.
That’s when his obsession with movement and mechanics began. Spend some time with Kelly, and
you become distinctly aware that he sees and processes everything through a 300x lens. As his wife,
Juliet Starrett, once told me, Kelly can sense illness and injury in others before any symptoms have
manifested. It was natural that he gravitated toward becoming a doctor of physical therapy, and later
becoming an innovative thinker in performance-related solutions at the internationally regarded Stone
Clinic in San Francisco.
One day, while practicing a series of combat moves with a knife that he saw in a video on the
Internet, Kelly stumbled upon CrossFit, the then-fledgling fitness program based on constantly varying
functional movements performed at high intensity. Soon enough, he and Juliet opened up one of the
first CrossFit affiliates in the world, San Francisco CrossFit. His physical therapy insight and
knowledge, let loose within the lab-like environment that is a CrossFit gym, enabled him to observe
and learn from the many thousands of workouts through which he coached his gym’s members. It
spawned an electrically charged new line of thinking about how to solve the various problems that
crop up in regard to athletic performance.
This book is about running. Distance running, yes, but also the problems that all athletes who run
face—from those just beginning in fitness to the professional NFL cornerback who runs as a player
and also in training. It’s for CrossFit athletes—many of whom make it clear that they “hate” running—
and for experienced ultramarathoners who are sick of being mired in injuries.
By improving the positions you adopt and the health of the tissues involved and
installing normal range of motion in your joints, you may find additional energy to
help you run faster and longer.
 
The ideas and framework that Kelly sets forth in this book are not just about preventing and dealing
with injuries. A tremendous bonus to solving injury-related problems with solutions based on
mechanics, position, and mobility is that it also frees up extra performance that you may not have
known you had. The same tissue restrictions that are causing your knee pain may also be robbing you
of some hidden flow of power output. By improving the positions you adopt and the health of the
tissues involved and installing normal range of motion in your joints, you may find additional energy
to help you run faster and longer.
In my case, opening my mind to Kelly’s ideas was not just about solving a nagging injury. It was
about solving all of my nagging injuries—including one that, as I can see looking back, was similar to
what Kelly experienced on his last day as a professional kayaker.
It was November 2011, and I was staying in a Midtown hotel in New York City. I was five weeks
away from running a half-marathon in Las V
egas. It was a Saturday, and my training plan called for a
tempo run of 4.5 miles at a pace where I would average 170 to 175 heartbeats per minute.
As I prepared to knock out the run on a treadmill in the hotel gym, I didn’t have a clue how much
this single workout would impact the direction of my life as an athlete and a runner.
My goal for the half-marathon was not time-specific. Rather, it was to log an uninterrupted year of
consistent training, a feat that had eluded my grasp for more than a decade. It was a clear-cut, blue-
collar task, like polishing off a year of work as a truck driver—nothing fancy about it. Yet it was as if
I was driving the truck on a road riven into shards of rock. When I started training in 2011, I dared to
look back at the wreckage of the preceding years of struggling to maintain my identity as an athlete.
On rare occasions I was able to hold it together long enough to earn a marathon or Ironman finisher’s
T-shirt, but I would pay dearly after such efforts, moving through life as if I had jumped through the
windshield of my truck and effectively run over myself.
In my 40s, my injuries ran wild. I was like a scene from The Evil Dead. Stabbing chronic knee
pains and a trick back upended whatever running goal I was limping my way toward. These stoppages
and their inherent psychological free falls came with the added drag of getting fat. When I was at my
fastest as a runner, I weighed 160 to 165 pounds. After one of my injury forays, my weight floated up
toward 210. Which made my next attempt at defying the pattern of chronic injury all the harder.
It is painfully embarrassing to recount the debilitating injuries I stacked one on top of the other for
so many years.
I’m like a lot of folks who run or play sports that involve running: I do it for the fresh air and sanity
that it delivers. I am inspired by the 70-, 80-, and 90-somethings who refuse to retire themselves to
full-time spectator status. I’ve watched an 80-year-old finish an Ironman triathlon—2.4 miles of
swimming, 112 miles of biking, and 26.2 miles of running—in under 17 hours. I talked to a 60-year-
old German triathlete over the phone who had completed an Ironman in under 10 hours.
On weekends, I walk my dog near a field where a crowd of athletes who are around 60 years old
play soccer, and just the other day, while at the CrossFit Games, I saw a video featuring a CrossFitter
who was 100 years old.
For more and more people of all ages and backgrounds, being an athlete is at least as important as
cheering for the stars who play on a favorite big-league team. I love watching a good football game,
but I find participating in the local Turkey Trot more satisfying than watching the Super Bowl. (A
great Super Bowl Sunday for me is one where I do a race in the morning and then watch the game in
the afternoon.) I’d argue that being able to think of yourself as an athlete is more vital than having
season tickets to anything.
Over the years, I’ve spoken with scores of former couch potatoes who were transformed by a first
triathlon or first CrossFit workout. One quick example: A woman who has since become a good
friend of mine, Irene Mejia, weighed 400 pounds when she started CrossFit. Her self-image was
1,000 light-years away from any thoughts of being an athlete. She could barely walk, let alone run.
Now, Irene has slashed that weight almost in half. She trains, she runs, and she competes in
CrossFit-style competitions. As another friend put it, “Becoming an athlete saved her life.”
Running well is integral to many sports.1 Running fast, running a lot, and being able to do so
without collecting chronic injury problems is crucial to being able to train and compete. Whether
running itself is your thing, or whether you run to train for a sport, or whether running is a key part of
your sport, running is (as discussed in Chapter 2) part of the fabric of being a human being—
especially a modern human being who pursues the likes of soccer, basketball, track and field, or
CrossFit. For first responders in the military, law enforcement, and firefighting worlds, being able to
run (often under load and in extreme circumstances) is vital to saving lives.
Recreational distance running, by the way, is booming. According to the 2013 National Runner
Survey, most of us run to stay healthy, have fun, and burn off stress. The ritual of running is a form of
meditation for many of the 30 million Americans identified by the Sport & Fitness Association as
“core participant” runners. Yet it’s also a competitive challenge: In 2013, 541,000 people finished a
marathon in the United States, a country that hosts some 1,100 opportunities to complete the classic
26.2-mile distance. The running boom of the 1970s continues to this day: More women are running,
more Masters runners are competing, and a record amount of money is being spent on gear, with
expectations that in the coming years nearly $4 billion will be spent annually on shoes alone.
So when injuries steal running away from you, it can hit you hard. Again, I’m not atypical of
American runners. Surveys and research suggest that approximately three out of four runners get at
least one running-related injury per year. For those runners training for a marathon, 90 percent
struggle with some form of ailment in the process.
And it’s not just pure runners who become afflicted by these types of overuse injuries. In a recent
interview, Dr. Nicolas Romanov, a famed sports scientist and an expert on running and human
movement, told me that data being collected in the soccer world is equally alarming. “The players
spend tremendous amounts of time refining their soccer skills, but not their running skills,” he said.
He went on to tell me that in his analysis of soccer players, very few run well. Running is left to
chance, and injuries swoop in and bite hard.
Romanov had the same thing to say about elite CrossFit athletes. Although technique is emphasized
in the Olympic lifting and gymnastics elements of this fitness discipline, he sees few CrossFitters who
run with good form. “They have all the strength they could ever possibly need to run well,” he told
me. “They just don’t put any thought into their running positions and mechanics.” This lack of
attention, he added, puts even the most powerful athletes at risk for injury when they do an interval
workout or a distance run.
In 2011, I was on the brink. I had simply decided to bulldoze my way through any injury or hint of
injury. I stretched, did a core strength routine, and practiced the most vigilant and restrictive diet I
could think of, going vegan. I spent hundreds of dollars on motion-control shoes and high-end arch
supports. When injuries did stir, I opted to complete my workouts on a treadmill, figuring that the
reduction in pounding would help.
Which is why I was doing my run on the hotel treadmill in New York. The day before, while
walking in the city, my right knee had begun collapsing on me. My many years of experience with
running injuries hadn’t prepared me for this weird iteration of a funky knee problem. I would walk
three or four steps and then it would just buckle, as if the joint was a hinge and someone was sneakily
pulling the pin on me.
It was a bad enough problem that each time my knee gave out, I attracted an assortment of
concerned looks from my fellow pedestrians.
I hoped that it was a temporary glitch that would evaporate like a bad dream. But it never did.
Rather, the condition of my knee degraded as the day wore on. That night, I spent $70 on knee braces,
ice bags, and monster bottle of Advil at a Duane Reade. I turned my hotel room into an impromptu
medical tent.
The next day, I prepared for the tempo run by wrapping my knee with an Ace bandage and then
buckling on the knee brace I’d bought. A handful of Advil had been digested, and the anti-
inflammatory chemicals were whizzing through my circulatory system.
Repressing all the capacity I had for rational judgment, I discovered that if I focused my attention
on landing my foot at a certain angle, I could keep the mysterious knee-collapsing pattern at bay. This
tactic worked well enough that I was able to pull off the entire tempo run. I felt incredible relief as I
iced the knee following the workout.
Thanks to what I’ve learned from Kelly, I now understand that my misguided treadmill workout
was the final cost in a long series of charges, and it was time to pay. There would be no more running
in 2011. Despite my consultations with sports medicine clinicians and my manic interventions with
massage therapy and anti-inflammatories, my leg had gone on strike. Some inner mechanism of
evolutionary wisdom encoded into my brain shut me down, saying, “Your authority over the guidance
and usage of the right leg has been rescinded until further notice.” My goal to complete a year of
consistent training was a shambles.
I’ve had a few years to reflect on my fevered state of mind in late 2011, when I felt that injury was
a natural by-product of being a runner. Injuries were meant to be avoided if possible through the right
choice of running shoes, but otherwise, you just ran through them as best you could. Injuries were the
enemy, and it was a mind-over-matter thing.
It never dawned on me that my vigorous denial and reliance on over-the-counter interventions
might be flawed. It also never occurred to me that the injuries were manifestations of weak spots in
my personal infrastructure and the way I ran. A deeper look into the root cause of each and every
injury would have uncovered a hole or weakness that—if corrected—would have offered me not just
a pain-free running experience, but also more performance: more speed, more endurance, and faster
race times recorded with less energy burned.
I was incredibly lucky to have been talking with the founder of CrossFit Endurance, ultrarunner
Brian MacKenzie, who helped open my mind to a new way of thinking about running, being a runner,
and the role of injury. Because if I had stayed the course and tried to do another power-sweep through
2012 the way I had through 2011, I almost certainly would have ended up having a knee or hip
replaced or an Achilles tendon surgically repaired.
MacKenzie teaches an innovative approach that integrates running technique, strength and
conditioning, and nutrition into a low-mileage/high-performance/low-injury world of distance running
that I never could have imagined. As my blood loyalty to traditional methods of distance running
finally eased, I listened to what MacKenzie was saying. After considering the depth and breadth of
my injury problems, the first thing he said to me was, “You need to see Kelly Starrett.”
A few weeks later I met with Kelly, who is a doctor of physical therapy, and was set on a new
path. My knee—which had continued to buckle on me every few steps for weeks—quickly found a
new life of stability. Since the day I met Kelly, I haven’t limped. I also was set on a journey that has
allowed me to return to a full embrace of running that feels almost bulletproof. The ideas, practices,
and techniques that he put forth to me and countless other runners who have moved through the world
of the MobilityWOD have been sharpened and distilled into the pages of the book you now hold in
your hands.
It enabled me to once again live the athlete’s life.
But it’s my contention that a new generation of leaders in the running world—like Kelly Starrett,
Brian MacKenzie, Nicholas Romanov, a running podiatrist named Nick Campitelli, and Born to Run
author Christopher McDougall—have an underlying message that is finally breaking through and
driving a new era in running forward. This message is not merely a list of programming ideas and
techniques. It’s much more vast and cogent.
In Kelly’s case, it’s the main thrust of his position, and it’s the first thing you read when you log
onto MobilityWOD.com, the website he co-founded with his wife, Juliet:
“All human beings should be able to perform basic maintenance on
themselves.”
 
 
He says that although we may not think we have a choice, we do. If you like running and hate being
injured, you can take matters into your own hands and fundamentally shut the door on the chronic
injuries that drive you nuts.
What if you can’t even begin to imagine that you are a runner? Running either seems too
inaccessible or too ridden with pain, or you have been led to believe that you were born with flat feet
or bad knees and that running is for others, not for you. Whether it’s running in a 10k or rattling off a
quarter-mile repeat in a CrossFit workout, somewhere along the line you have been told or have
come to the conclusion that running is too damaging for you.
To unbind yourself from this thinking, it begins with understanding that “All human beings should
be able to perform basic maintenance on themselves.” It’s not a magic pill, but it is a path of thinking
and working that holds within it the promise that you can free the athlete within.
It’s simple, but it’s not easy, and the first thing you have to let go of is the belief that all you have to
do (or all you can do) is hand your credit card to a physical therapist, a podiatrist, or a salesperson at
a running shoe store and expect someone else to fix the problem. Being Ready to Run requires your
attention and work.
There’s no magical cure. In fact, what the raging debate about minimalist shoes versus traditional
running shoes has exposed is that the debate is asking the wrong question. When it comes to running
injuries, the elephant in the room is that shoes aren’t the fix. Decades of running shoe technology have
failed to slow the rate of injury among runners.
The shoe itself is not going to cure your ails, whether it’s a minimalist shoe or a 16-ounce motion-
control shoe. Same goes for orthotics, muscle stim, ultrasound, heel lifts, knee supports, and the
thousands of dollars you can easily sink into the sports medicine industrial complex. The real game-
changer is the attitude you and I adopt in our lives as runners: the conviction that we are responsible
for taking care of our running machines like a master mechanic would. As Chris McDougall has said
in response to Born to Run critics—the ones who read the book and rushed off to buy a pair of
minimalist running shoes expecting that they would instantly be transformed into barefoot runners,
only to get injured within a matter of days or weeks—they missed the point. Yes, you can reclaim the
natural running capacities that you were born with, but you’ve got to do the work. Smart, patient,
consistent work. If you are looking for a magic pill in a running shoe—or any other intervention, for
that matter—you’re doomed to the treadmill of injury, with the prospect that you will one day wear
something out for real.
The real game-changer is the attitude we adopt in our lives as runners: the conviction
that we are responsible for taking care of our running machines like a master
mechanic would.
 
This is both the challenge and the promise of this book for those who want to be able to run well
and run often until the end of their days. You are born to run. Although modern living, poor running
form, muscular imbalances, and being stubborn enough to think that you can run through injuries like a
tank through a field of saplings (the latter being one I’m particularly guilty of) may have set you back,
there is a reset button that you can push. It all starts with taking responsibility, plotting a course of
action, and being patient, thorough, and persistent in seeing it done today, tomorrow, and forever after.
Kelly Starrett’s mindset and approach are meant to be the bridge. If you want to unleash all the
power and endurance that your body was indeed born with, Ready to Run will help get you there.
 
1 It’s not necessary, however
. In fact, two of the most impressive athletes I have had the privilege of writing about are
David Bailey and Carlos Moleda. Bailey was a motocross superstar who was paralyzed in an accident on a jump; Moleda a
Navy SEAL who was shot and paralyzed during the U.S. operation to remove Noriega from power in 1989. They became
competitors in the challenged-athlete division of the Hawaii Ironman, recording one of the greatest rivalries in the history
of multisport.
INTRODUCTION
 
A TYPICAL DAY IN THE LIFE OF A RUNNER
You are a full court press runner, and this is what it looks like:
 
After six, maybe seven hours of sleep, the alarm goes off at 4:30. It’s dark, it’s cold, it’s
Wednesday. The Earth is whirling rapidly on its axis. Tasks in your immediate future include
preparing an eight-year-old for school: getting up, getting dressed, preparing breakfast, and packing
the backpack, including homework and lunch, plus delivering her safely to the cul-de-sac of the
elementary school. You also need to wedge in time for one last rehearsal of a PowerPoint
presentation you will be giving at 9:00, and there’s a 40-minute drive-time commute to be negotiated.
But first, you want to squeeze in your daily run. Either you run now in the pre-dawn, or it’s just not
going to happen. The morning run is a task—and despite any lingering soreness or nagging pains, your
mind is set with unbendable intent. When it comes to the completion of this task, you will not be
denied.
So you’re awake at 4:30, and it’s dark, and freezing rain is falling at a steep slant. You step from
the bed into a pair of flip-flops with arch supports in them so that you don’t put any undue pressure on
your always-touchy arches.
You assimilate appropriate weather-resistant attire, throw back an Americano, and you’re out the
door. During the first mile and a half, you feel all the usual hotspots flare: that pinch of pain just
below your right kneecap, the swelling in the bone of your right heel, the nervy sketchiness deep in
the socket of your left hip. You have invested considerable American Express capacity toward a
variety of measures meant to dull these various stings: Over-the-counter orthotics planted in $150
motion-control shoes. A neoprene and rubber tourniquet strapped just below the knee that came with
the following promise: Don’t let tendinitis, cartilage wear, or chondromalacia stop your training!
The pains simmer down, and you knock out the rest of the 5-miler. If you can carve out a minute of
time, you kick up a foot onto a park bench, try to touch your toes, and spend 20 seconds or so doing
what you think of as a hamstring stretch. You get back to the house in time to begin the rest of the
morning adventure. The 5 miles of the week’s 45 are logged. You remain on course for your upcoming
race.
After delivering your presentation, you repair to your office, sit down at your computer, and begin
motoring through work. In your dress shoes are a different pair of arch supports with an extra few
millimeters of heel lift to take the edge off the soreness in your Achilles tendon. When you walk, your
feet angle outward and cave in, and your knees follow in a subtle yet degenerative way, cementing the
pattern of your current foot strike, one that chews away at the soft tissues around your knees. The arch
supports are supposed to defray this problem as well. Then there’s your back: You’ve thought about
getting some sort of lumbar support to attach to your work chair to help buffer that always-lurking
sciatica pain that has started shooting through your hips and threatens to bring your running to a halt.
In a drawer of your desk is a bottle holding nearly 100 coated gel caplets, each spring-loaded with
200 milligrams of ibuprofen.
Take a moment to appreciate the dedication involved here. You may not be an Olympian, but tell
me that there isn’t an Olympian’s drive at work in powering through a day like this, week in, week
out, month after month, year after year.
The human body is an amazing, adaptable, nearly unstoppable survival machine
designed to absorb the wear-and-tear of millions of duty cycles.
 
The only thing that will slow you down? Or stop you? If you’re like nearly 80 percent of runners,
an injury is going to force you to stop at some point in the year (and you’re at even more risk if you
heel-strike, or land on your heel as opposed to your mid-foot or forefoot, when you run). Rather than
lacing up a pair of shoes, you’ll be cinching up an AquaJogger or strapping your feet into the pedals
of a Lifecycle.
Here’s the thing: The human body is an amazing, adaptable, nearly unstoppable survival machine
designed to absorb the wear-and-tear of millions of duty cycles. The above example demonstrates
how the body can absorb a tremendous amount of damage before serving up the kind of injury that
forces a complete stop.
Living through that kind of daily schedule is only adding to the wear-and-tear caused by the daily
run. The tissues are dehydrated, like beef jerky, and are not given adequate time to warm up. The
shoes are enabling a heel strike that increases the forces of shear and the amount of impact stress on
the body—it’s like driving a Ferrari with the hand brake on.
 
But what if I were to tell you that there is another way? This routine requires an impressive amount
of self-discipline and desire. What if you channeled some of that energy into several small, new
habits that produce two types of results?
 
Improved performance
Reduced risk of injury
In Ready to Run, I want you to explore a new way of thinking about those signal flares that the
various tissues and structures of your body send up. If you find yourself trying to bury nagging chronic
injury pain through common interventions, like new shoes, inserts, ice, and ibuprofen, I want you to
find a new appreciation for the signals you’re receiving from your body, whether it’s arch pain, back
pain, a dull ache in your hamstring, or a sharp pain under your knee. Each of these signals is a clue to
how you can unleash more performance. By solving the underlying problem, you will not only
extinguish the pain and prevent the injury that is rising to the surface, but also gain an additional
measure of speed, power, or efficiency—and likely a combination of those three elements.
A BETTER DAY
Let’s reconsider how you might approach that morning routine by looking through this alternate lens:
 
You get up at 4:30 and, in addition to or instead of a cup of coffee, you down 16 ounces of water
mixed with an electrolyte enhancer like Osmo or Nuun. As always, you walk about the house
barefoot. While you drink your water/electrolyte solution to help restore the water you lost while
sleeping, you perform a brief mobility drill to open up your hip extension and unglue the sliding
surfaces around your heel cords.
If your training schedule calls for a run or a workout that includes running, instead of wearing an
overbuilt motion-control running shoe that shortens your heel cord and acts like a cast, you have
progressed to a flat, zero-drop running shoe that enables your foot to work like a foot.
You spend the first part of your running workout performing a CrossFit Endurance–style warm-up,
mixing 100-meter runs and dynamic movements with 100-meter jogs to engage and warm up the
muscles and connective tissues that will be called upon for the workout. Then, thoroughly warmed up
and hot, with the juices flowing, you launch into your run for the day (or CrossFit workout, or
basketball practice—whatever your athletic discipline that includes running).
You spend the last part of your running workout warming down with something as simple as a five-
minute walk. This assists your lymphatic system in doing the job of removing wastes from the
interstitial fluids surrounding the muscles and connective tissues that just propelled you through your
workout.
Later, at the office, you try to sit as little as possible so as not to shut off your lymphatic system or
shorten the muscles that support a neutral spine position. When you stand and walk, you monitor the
position of your feet—they are straight—and maintain a light engagement of the muscles of your butt
and core to set your pelvis and spine in a neutral position. When you do have to sit, you remain
especially aware of maintaining a neutral posture. You have also built in the habit of blending in short
mobility drills every hour or two to fix your feet, improve your spinal position, and work the areas
above and below any missing bits of motor control and range of motion that are impeding your
performance and adding to your risk of injury. You eat a nutritious diet, you hydrate with electrolyte
fluids, and you have added compression socks to your work wardrobe to again help open up the pipes
so that your lymphatic system replaces waste products with nutrient flow.
You’ve dumped the Advil. Replacing it in your desk drawer is a bicycle tube so that you can zap
inflammation with a bout of V
ooDoo Floss Band compression.
At night, you dedicate 10 minutes to the effort of ferreting out any warning signs that your body may
be sending you—nagging signals that you treat not as fires to be stamped out, but as problems to be
solved, with fresh performance to be gained as a result. It’s not about just getting in some stretching.
Your worldview of solving athletic dysfunction problems has expanded far beyond the simple and
ineffectual hamstring stretch. Rather, you are on a mission to correct missing range of motion
problems and poor movement patterns—you know that any weaknesses in motor control and range of
motion are opportunities to inject a solid performance boost into your running.
You are on a mission to correct missing range of motion problems and poor movement
patterns.
 
NO MAGIC PILL
This isn’t a stretching book. It’s a book for the Formula 1 runner seeking health and high performance
over a lifetime. All human beings should be able and willing to perform basic maintenance on
themselves. Sports medicine has its place, but you have both a right and a responsibility to know
what’s going on in your body, take care of as much business as you can, and harvest any performance
that’s hiding in the shadows.
 
Which gets to the “why” of this book. Running is a part of your athletic lifestyle. But there’s a fatal
flaw in the running universe, and it has to do with a decision-making flowchart loop that runners
everywhere put to use.
Have you ever experienced the following sequence of problems, thoughts, and actions?
 
1. Y
ou go for a run.
2. After the run, you notice a piercing pain in the usual hotspots: knee, ankle, hip, back.
3. Y
ou ice and stretch, but at the end of the day the pain is still there.
4. The next day, hoping that it was all a bad dream, you lace up your shoes and head out the
door for a 4-mile test jog.
5. It hurts during first mile. Y
ou say a short, impassioned prayer to the running gods to make
this bad dream go away. Y
ou stop by a tree, try to stretch it out, and then continue.
6. Halfway through, you decide to either walk back or finish the run despite hobbling pain
that is worsening.
7. While walking back, you think, “I guess I need a new shoe.” It could mean selecting a
different model of shoe or replacing a worn-out shoe. Y
ou hope that if you visit a shoe
store, the problem will vanish with the swipe of a credit card.
This kind of thinking is the fatal flaw: It’s not about the shoe. It never was, and it never will be.
It’s not about the shoe. It never was, and it never will be. It’s about you.
 
When it comes to preventing injuries, the shoe is like the bumper on a car. It offers a layer of
protection from the pavement. But when it comes to preventing the intrinsic injuries that are chronic
and due to poor mechanics, shoes are not the key to the equation.
What leads to this flawed thinking may be the magic pill idea. You have a problem that needs to be
solved, and it would be great if you could just walk into a store, give your credit card a brief
workout, and have it all done with. This same appeal can be found in visits to sports medicine
clinics, massage therapists, and the like. While these services can be exceptionally valuable in your
life as an athlete, it’s the good physiotherapists who give you the upfront, hard truth that the solution
cannot be comprised of a shoe and an orthotic. It’s not about the shoes.
What’s it about? It’s about the power you have to make real and lasting change that has the added
value of helping you prevent injury as well as uncork new streams of performance.
It’s not about the shoes. It’s about you.
READY TO RUN
What does it mean to be Ready to Run? Whether you’re the classic type-A runner I described earlier,
or whether running is a part of your sport or your job, I want you to embrace a sort of system check
that will inform you on how well tuned your body and your lifestyle are for the various stresses that
running places on you. In meeting all of the standards outlined in Part 2 of this book, or at least
moving the needle as close as you can to these standards, you will gain confidence that you’re
optimizing power and minimizing injury risk. The standards are related to your shoes, your physical
readiness, your ability to use good positions, your efforts to prepare and recover from training
sessions, and the lifestyle choices that affect your overall health and physical condition.
 
If you are Ready to Run, you have the following things going for you:
 
Y
ou have developed a habit of drinking more than 100 ounces of electrolyte-enhanced
water each day, thereby ensuring that your tissues are properly hydrated and healthy.
Y
ou have a normal amount of hip extension, a key to enabling optimal hip function for more
power, more performance, and better mechanics throughout your musculoskeletal system.
Y
ou are free of hotspots because, as a part of your ongoing attention to maintenance, you
no longer try to run through small, nagging injuries, but rather consider them as signals
that you need to improve your positions, mechanics, and tissue health.
There’s plenty more—there are 12 standards. My first mission is to give you a detailed look at
each standard to explain what it is and why it’s important. After that, I’ll go into how to improve your
performance in the standards, arming you with an array of mobility exercises that—when performed
on a consistent basis—will effect positive change and help you become as Ready to Run as possible.
PART 1
Have you ever asked your physician what to do about an irritating knee or foot problem and received
the following two-word prescription: “Stop running”
 
Or maybe you’re a longtime distance runner who’s collected a shoebox full of marathon finisher
medals, and you’ve become so mired in chronic injuries that you’re thinking it’s time to take up
cycling. Or you’re convinced that you just weren’t born to be a runner. I used to think this way. As a
teen, I was an all-around athlete, but the farthest I could run without my knee hurting was 100 yards. I
was convinced that I was born to do many things, but running was not one of them. Does that sound
familiar? Maybe you think you don’t have the right feet, or your knees are shot, or you just don’t have
the right body for running. So you’ve avoided running (to the best of your ability) as either a sport or
a training mode. For example, you’re a CrossFitter who can deadlift 500 pounds easily, but when a
workout calls for hard intervals, you brace yourself for a spirit-breaking day or avoid the session
altogether.
 
In the process of becoming a coach and a physical therapist and developing an obsession with the
physics of movement, position, and mechanics, I realized that we are all designed to be lifelong
runners. We may have to put in some work to reset ourselves, but the path is clear.
 
In my case, at 230 pounds, I was able to run the Quad Dipsea ultramarathon in a pair of 5-ounce flat
shoes. How? It starts with unlearning some things. This is the first step in being Ready to Run.
CHAPTER 1
THE DURABLE RUNNER
 
Would you like to get all the running mileage that your body was designed to put out?
 
It starts at the top, with the Olympic marathon, and with imagery that tends to endure longer than
that of the first athlete breaking the tape or setting a new world record. In 1968, John Stephen
Akhwari of Tanzania limped into the Olympic stadium with strands of athletic tape wrapped around
his right knee. He was last, finishing an hour after the winner. The visual of mind-over-body-at-all-
costs inspired one journalist to say that it was “a performance that gives meaning to the word
courage.”
In the 1984 Olympics, Swiss runner Gabriele Andersen-Schiess entered the Olympic stadium some
twenty minutes after gold medalist Joan Benoit. Charlie Lovett captures the scene quite well in his
book Olympic Marathon:
“The crowd gasped in horror as she staggered onto the track, her torso twisted, her left arm
limp, her right leg mostly seized. She waved away medical personnel who rushed to help
her, knowing that, if they touched her, she would be disqualified. The L.A. Coliseum crowd
applauded and cheered as she limped around the track in the race’s final 400 meters,
occasionally stopping and holding her head.”2
 
He also could have mentioned that her knee were horribly valgus, collapsing inward with each foot
strike, the soft-tissue friction almost shooting sparks. She did all this for thirty-seventh place.
The cheering from the crowd was so loud that Anderson-Schiess—despite the fact that her body
was shutting down in front of the approving audience that packed the Coliseum—tried to dig up
enough motor control to stick her fingers in her ears.
The image of a broken-down runner finishing an epic endurance race despite any and all physical
costs has become part of the ethos of the marathon world. Bent, twisted, and limping, with his wet-
tissue systems fried and compromised, he waves off help, crosses the line, and becomes the hero of
the day.
The Olympics is the Olympics, and there’s a lot to be said about sacrifice and the Olympic Games,
but the fact that this task-completion mentality trickles down through the running world is cause for
alarm, or at least discussion. There were 541,000 marathon finishers in the United States in 2013.3
Go spend an hour at the finish after the four-hour finishers have received their medals. Watch the
mechanics, the limping, the braces, and the K tape being used to get some of these folks across the
line.
Courage is a fantastic thing. I’m all about courage. But when that courage is deployed to force an
unprepared or otherwise compromised human body over the 33,000 steps required for a marathon,
we should be honest about the costs involved.
What’s tremendous about runners is their task-completion mindset. It can also be their undoing.
110 YEARS
Consider for a moment the life of a Major League Baseball player—perhaps a pitcher with a 95 mph
fastball. As Tom V
erducci wrote in Sports Illustrated:
 
“Walk into any major league clubhouse before a game and you will see all kinds of strength
trainers, masseuses, massage therapists, doctors, whirlpools, hydrotherapy pools, hot tubs,
cold tubs, weight rooms, gyms…and injured pitchers.”4
 
If you’re a starting pitcher playing 35 games a year and you have a long career in the majors (being
a pitcher and having a long career in the majors tend to be mutually exclusive), you likely will trash
your shoulder and elbow more than a few dozen times over. Let’s say you retire at age 30 and, thanks
to the ceaseless grind of a high-powered repetitive motion, you’ve worn out something for real.
If you were making $10 million a year or more, that experience probably goes down in the books
fairly well. You gave your arm to baseball and were well compensated for it.
But a runner? This is what I want you to think about. If you have any of these three performance-
sucking problems (and they tend to come as a set), then you’re accelerating the burn rate of your joints
and soft tissues each time your foot strikes the ground:
 
Poor positions
Restricted range of motion
Habitual poor movement patterns
Although your body is designed to last you 110 years, you can shred through it in 20 if you try hard
enough.
If you have a multimillion-dollar contract in place, there may be room for debate. But if you’re
running for the sheer love of it…what then?
The human body is an amazing and adaptable machine that jumps when you tell it to jump, through
all sorts of past injuries and new injuries that may be rising to the surface. When the mind says yes,
the body obeys. Until it comes to a smoking halt.
There’s a cost, and the cost is this: If you want to enjoy being a runner for as many of those years as
possible—and when I say “enjoy,” I also mean to tap into all the speed, power, and endurance that
your amazing machine has to offer—then it’s your job to support the task-completion ethos with
another ethos:
If you’re going to make the demands on your body that being an athlete
requires, then it’s your job to support that body.
 
Supporting your body means constantly working toward installing and maintaining the following
practices:
 
Habitually seeking optimal positions from which to transmit power
Developing the movement systems of your body so that they have access to the full ranges
of motion that your body was designed to have
Practicing and mastering good movement patterns and positions
Developing the strength and conditioning to support good movement patterns from the first
mile to the twenty-sixth and beyond
If you’ve suffered an injury that requires a visit to the primary care doctor listed on your health
insurance policy, you likely know the drill: You can see from the shoes she’s wearing that she’s not a
runner, so you see it coming fast, that moment after she assesses your Achilles tendinopathy or patella
tendinitis and then looks you in the eye as if you should not have left the mental hospital earlier than
scheduled, because the antidote is as obvious as the smell of the exam room disinfectant.
“Stop running,” she says.
That’s not me. I’m on your side. I want you to run today, I want you to run well, I want you to
improve, and someday, when the time comes, I want you to be the badass at the all-comers track meet
who is the only one in the 90-to-95-year-old age group to report to the starting line for the 400 meters.
Consider this book an owner’s manual for the high-performance runner-for-life.
KEY PRINCIPLES
To get started, I want you to think about the key principles on which the Ready to Run approach is
based.
 
It’s about performance
When you think of injury prevention, you probably think of those techniques recommended in
magazine articles that are supposed to reduce ankle pronation or soften the impact of your foot strike.
This usually entails using orthotics and running less on the pavement and more on the golf course. But
these techniques are like Band-Aids that only help stall the inevitable.
 
What I’m after in this book is to motivate and guide you toward the attainment of 12 clear and
measurable standards that will hit the reset button on how you move and how you think about
movement. The payoff from doing the work to achieve and maintain these standards is more than
reducing your risk of injury, and more than putting a stop to wearing out your joints. When you fix
problems and retrain your body to move well, you also allow for greater performance—more power,
more speed, and you’ll be able to hold it together longer, too. You will reduce the risk of injuries,
yes, but in the process you’ll also get better.
Alter the task-completion mindset
It’s great that you have the discipline to climb out of bed at 4:30 in the morning and check your daily
run off the list before the first hint of dawn. That’s fantastic. But I want more from you. I’m asking you
to go the extra mile and hold the quality of your running to a higher standard. That means asking
yourself these kinds of questions:
 
 
How well do you run each mile?
Do you warm up your systems and tissues before you run?
Do you hydrate?
Do you cool down?
Do you spend the bulk of your day standing, moving, and sitting with an awareness of the
quality of your positions and mechanics?
Do you counter any lousy movement patterns with an appropriate dose of maintenance
work?
It’s great that you are steadfast and consistent with your training. But in taking your dedication to
another level, you will get the most out of each and every training session.
Take personal responsibility for routine maintenance
So you’re a runner, and a busy one at that—so busy that you wish to farm out injury prevention and
rehab to professionals. Let them worry about it, in other words. Well, the sports medicine industrial
complex is happy to take this task off your shoulders and help you lighten up your wallet at the same
time. Sure, there are times when you need a doctor or physiotherapist to help you work through
problems and make decisions. But the hard truth is that routine maintenance on your personal running
machine can be and should be performed by you.
 
Routine maintenance on your personal running machine can be and should be
performed by you.
 
This is a bedrock principle within this book, and it is the primary directive of my teaching. When it
comes to this running machine, you can change the oil and inflate the tires. I know you’re busy, I know
your day is crammed, and I know you have a boss and a spouse and your kid’s science fair project to
help out with. That’s why, when it comes to routine maintenance, I’m asking for just 10 minutes a day.
No days off
I’m asking for just 10 minutes a day for maintenance work, but you need to put in those 10 minutes
every day. No days off, no excuses.
 
It’s a learning process that never ends
The path I am offering here will help you solve problems and set your running free. Each problem you
solve will help you tap into the athletic potential that’s been hidden in the shadows. But new
problems will crop up. This is a part of your new mindset. In the old task-completion model, aches
and pains that begin to stir are annoyances to be plowed over with a hamstring stretch and a bag of
ice. The new model suggests a different attitude: When you find a new problem to solve, rather than
turn on the ignition in the bulldozer or sink into despair, I want you to embrace it.
 
Problems are going to keep coming. Each one is a gift waiting to be opened—some new area of
performance you didn’t know you had, or some new efficiency to be gained. The 90- to 95-year-old
division of the Masters Track and Field Nationals awaits. A lifelong commitment to solving each
problem that creeps up is the ticket.
Mobilizing replaces stretching
Two minutes of half-assed stretching can do a tight muscle more harm than good. Think about what
would happen if you took your favorite T-shirt, grabbed it at two ends, and gave it a good, long, static
stretch. You would get a thinned-out, stretched-out T-shirt for your efforts. With that image in mind,
think of your muscle tissue. If you manage to stretch it out and lengthen it and then launch into a hard
run, do you think that you have the strength, conditioning, and specific coordination to support the
change in this variable? How does changing this one variable work within the long equation that is
the biological symphony of running? It’s a gamble. Starting now, take haphazard end-range muscle
stretching out of your routine and replace it with the intention of improving your range of motion as a
system—from how each joint sits in its socket, to the health of your tissues and sliding surfaces, to
your motor patterns. This mobilization approach is applied throughout the Ready to Run program.
 
I’m all about courage, hard work, and getting things done. But let’s reframe the conversation when
it comes to getting all the mileage that your human machine was engineered to deliver.

CHAPTER 2
BORN TO RUN
 
You run in races, or you run intervals during metabolic conditioning (“MetCon”) workouts, or you run
within your sport or on the battlefield in the service of your country. Or you want to be running in one
of these domains, but you have felt that you just don’t have what it takes.
 
You have what it takes. You have the design and the circuitry to run like the warrior-hunter-gatherer
you are.
You may not think that you can run, or that you can run well, but if you reverse-engineer your body,
there is only one conclusion to be drawn: Like the Terminator was designed to kill, as a human being
you were designed to run. As Christopher McDougall describes our ancestors in his book Born to
Run, running was hardwired in such a way that it was indispensable to survival:
“It was the way we thrived and spread across the planet. You ran to eat and to avoid being
eaten; you ran to find a mate and impress her, and with her you ran off to start a new life
together. You had to love running, or you wouldn’t live to love anything else.”5
 
SURVIV
AL OF THE SWIFTEST
It’s two million years ago. Do you know where your ancestors are?
 
Back in the early Pleistocene, human beings faced a real head-scratcher in trying to get through the
day. Lions, tigers, rhinoceroses, and leopards abounded, but it was about 1.4 million years before a
lightbulb went off and some hotshot thought to lash together a sharp stone and a stick to make a spear.
One way for humans to get a more substantial meal than, say, a handful of grass may have been to stay
awake at night and listen in on some tigers ripping apart their prey. At dawn, they ran to the scene to
get a handful of what was left. If they were spotted by a 600-pound tiger that could go from 0 to 35
mph in just a few heartbeats, they took off. Maybe they had their lucky club with them and maybe they
didn’t, but either way, running was likely the best solution.
You really were born Ready to Run.
There was scavenging the leftovers of lions and tigers, but also there was hunting. As Harvard
paleoanthropologist Daniel Lieberman and his colleagues have argued, early humans, for whom the
best available weapon was a club or a sharp stick, probably had to exercise the few advantages they
had over wildebeest and the like. The animals cooled themselves by panting and your ancestors could
sweat, so even though wildebeests could outsprint the early human hunter, they couldn’t outlast him—
not while galloping along for hours on a terrifically hot day. The hunter-gatherer loaded with sweat
glands would start the chase in the middle of a sunny day and never let the animal get a break under a
shady tree. Eventually, the wildebeest, zebra, antelope, or whatever, under relentless pressure from
the Homo erectus runner-type who could just keep going and going and going, would collapse—
hence the phrase “persistence hunting.”6
YOUR RUNNING WEAPONRY
It’s not just the gifts of peach-fuzz fur and a superior heat tolerance mechanism. Human beings have an
assortment of keen advantages over other mammals when it comes to running. So the next time you
hear someone say, “I could never run a marathon—I can’t even run around the block!” or you
encounter a CrossFitter who has tremendous work capacity and unbridled pain tolerance in the gym
but says, “I hate running,” here’s some evolutionary trivia to respond with:
 
 
Y
ou have springs. When you walk, your feet, legs, and body use a pendulum-like motion. But
shift into a run, and all the miraculous machinery that you were born with vaults into action—
your hips, knees, ankles, and feet work in concert with your muscles and connective tissues to
use gravity and elastic energy to bounce you along with breathtaking efficiency. “In fact, a
running human’s legs store and release energy so efficiently that running is only about 30 to 50
percent more costly than walking in the endurance-speed range,” says Daniel Lieberman in his
book The Story of the Human Body. “What’s more, these springs are so effective that they can
make the cost of endurance running (but not sprinting) independent of speed: it costs the same
number of calories to run five miles at a pace of either 7 or 10 minutes per mile.”
Y
ou have stable, springy arches. Your feet are serious machines designed not only for running,
but also for fast running—as well as the quick, agile changes of direction that we associate with
a star halfback in football. The mechanism that is the human arch, with its energy-returning
spring action, helps reduce the energy cost of running by up to 17 percent, according to
researchers.7
Y
ou have super-elastic Achilles tendons. Just a third of an inch long in a chimp, the human
Achilles tendon is 6 inches long. When you run, you show off the true power of your wondrous
heel cords: They can store and release 35 percent of the mechanical energy produced when you
run—something that doesn’t happen when you walk. The Achilles is all about helping you run.
Y
ou have a powerful butt. That’s right; your large glute muscles are not there just to fill out a
pair of designer jeans. You can walk around with your glutes essentially asleep. Break into a
sprint, however, and your butt becomes essential to your overall stability—it keeps you from
doing a face plant with every step. The glutes are the largest muscles in your body, and if you put
them to full advantage (a life of sitting in chairs can impede on the magnificent flow of power
that your posterior chain was engineered to channel), you will be using muscles that are
relatively inexhaustible.
Y
ou have ear canals like spacecraft guidance computers. Yes, even your ear canals are
specialized for good running. Running involves a lot more banging around than walking does—
just observe the figure-eight movement of a runner’s ponytail in action to get a sense of how
much is going on as you bound down the road. Like a computer with gyroscopes, the ear canals
transmit signals to your musculoskeletal system to correct for the constant flow of tiny
imbalances incurred in a bipedal organism on the move.
If you have any doubts that, thanks to millions of years of evolution, you were born to run—whether
you’re running on the field, on the court, in your combat boots, or in a marathon—read Lieberman’s
book The Story of the Human Body. There’s a reason you have short toes (foot stabilization 101), a
narrow waist in contrast to wide shoulders (power generated through optimal rotation), a powerful
butt, gyroscopes in your skull, and skin that radiates away excess body heat thanks to millions of
sweat glands: You were designed to run like the wind. This book is meant to help you let it rip.

PART 2
The mission of this book is to offer those who run or want to run a clear set of guidelines. Whether
you’re a distance runner, a soccer player, a CrossFitter, or a soldier, I want to help you make sure that
you are ready to be the best runner you can be and to decrease your chances of wear, tear, and injury.
The standards that I put forth in this part of the book are designed to help you determine how Ready to
Run you are and help you reach the optimal range of capacity that your body was designed to deliver.
CHAPTER 3
INTRODUCTION TO THE STANDARDS
 
In the following chapters, I introduce and explain the 12 standards that you’ll use to complete a
thorough assessment of your state of being Ready to Run. They are:
 
 
Neutral feet
Flat shoes
A supple thoracic spine
An efficient squatting technique
Hip flexion
Hip extension
Ankle range of motion
Warming up and cooling down
Compression
No hotspots
Hydration
Jumping and landing
Pursuing, achieving, and maintaining these 12 standards produces the following results:
 
Y
our tissues will be healthy and hydrated, and the surfaces between your tissues will slide
and glide rather than stick like Velcro.
Y
our joints will be in their proper positions.
Normal range of motion will be restored so that your ankles, knees, and hips work the way
they are designed to, unleashing your full power and minimizing the destructive forces that
can wear holes in your wheels.
Essential mechanics and motor control patterns will be reinstalled so that when you stand,
walk, and run, you are not chewing up cartilage and connective tissue.
Y
our hip function will be optimal, resulting in more power for your running, less stress on
your knees, and the capacity to run with good form, whether you’re a beginner setting out
on your first run or CrossFit workout, or you’re a longtime competitive runner heading into
the deepest, darkest corners of the fatigue that hits in long runs and races.
And more.
 
We all may be born to run, but something often goes awry along the way. Things go pretty well until
we have to buckle ourselves into desks in first grade. You see, your tissues and joints mold to the
positions in which you spend most of your time. If you spend a significant portion of each day bound
to a chair or in shoes that elevate your heels, your body becomes warped and restricted by those
patterns. Add to that a good chunk of time spent with your head hunched over your phone as you type
texts, and the results can be crippling. These new shapes and tendencies of your tissues and joints are
no longer conducive to running. You must now be reborn to run.
YOU CAN CHANGE
The first step on this path of rebirth is acknowledging that you can restore your natural capacities
despite the damage that you may have incurred from too much sitting, too little self-maintenance, and
too much reliance on overbuilt running shoes, painkillers, and sheer force of will to burn your way
through physical obstacles.
 
The key premise of this book is that you can change. It starts with the mindset that the key to
enjoying running for a lifetime lies within the body itself, and that your job is to pave the way.
The key to enjoying running for a lifetime lies within the body itself, and your job is to

What does it take to restore your tissues, joints, and mechanics to optimal levels? The 12 standards
are guideposts. They are targets that involve lifestyle, range of motion, movement capacity, and habits
related to running.
The standards are presented in a yes-or-no, binary fashion. There is no gray area. The test for each
standard will tell you that, yes, on that measure you are ready to run, or no, you have work to do to
meet that standard. There is no one-size-fits-all program for achieving the standards, but after you see
where you stand on each one, I’ll give you tools and strategies for flipping the switch from no to yes.
CHASING THE STANDARDS
Although I’ll go into more detail about this later in the book, I want to emphasize here the most
important criteria in chasing the standards. Keep these fundamental principles at the forefront of your
thinking:
 
 
Be patient. A standard may seem impossible to you when you perform the initial test—
especially if you have years of running combined with years of sitting in chairs under your belt.
First, don’t be discouraged. Your tissues have a remarkable capacity to change. If you’ve been
spending hours a day in a chair, your tissues have adapted to that position, which is not a
position that allows for powerful hip function. But your body has an elastic quality, and it can
change. Just know that it’s not going to happen overnight. Eat the elephant one bite at a time, as
they say. Set small goals and knock them out one by one. Commit yourself to the program for the
long haul. If you’re engaged in chipping away at a standard on a daily basis, you’re more than
halfway there. Going after it is where the money’s at.
Be creative. In Part 3, I offer a basic set of mobilizations to help you attack certain blockages
that may be preventing you from achieving a standard. These “mobs,” as I call them, will get you
started. But ultimately you’re in charge. There are multiple paths available, and I want you to
think creatively. If you travel by plane a lot and sit in the window seat for five hours or more at a
time, for example, go in armed for combat. Bring a rolling pin or softball with you on the plane,
wear compression gear, and bring a tube of electrolyte tablets for the water to hydrate. And what
about your overall strategy for achieving a challenging range of motion standard? You might ask,
“Is it okay to use Pilates to help me achieve the Hip Flexion standard?” Absolutely. You might
use Pilates, you might go to CrossFit classes, or you might dig up old Jack Lalanne episodes. Be
creative about how you build rituals into your life to seek, achieve, and maintain the standards.
Test and retest. Here’s a tactic to get the most out of your investment in this work: Test yourself
before and after performing a mobilization. For example, say you’re spending two minutes
working on ankle range of motion with a specific exercise. Test your range of motion before the
exercise, and then test it again afterward. Do you see an improvement? If you’ve registered a
change, great. If not, try a different mobilization or use a different tool—go hunting for the right
combination that initiates change in the tissue.
Keep after it. There is no finish line, of course. One of the mantras of the Ready to Run
program is “No Days Off.” Depending on your background, your age, the state of your tissues,
and the amount of work you put in, pursuing and maintaining the standards is like pursuing and
maintaining good dental health. It’s never over. If you’re just starting out—as a runner, a
CrossFitter, a field-sport athlete, an aspiring soldier, or maybe all of the above—don’t let the
distance of the journey overwhelm you. By investing 10 minutes a day over weeks and months,
you’ll be astonished at how much improvement you can grab in your pursuit of the more
challenging standards. If your goal is a complete fitness makeover, or to cultivate your potential
to run fast for your chosen sport, be steadfast in putting in that little bit of focused work, like
brushing and flossing your teeth, every day. Keep a training journal to record your progress, and
keep an eye on your performance against the standards. This is the secret to being Ready to Run
for a lifetime.
By investing 10 minutes a day over weeks and months, you’ll be astonished at how
much improvement you can grab.
CHAPTER 4
STANDARD #1: NEUTRAL FEET
Q: Are your feet habitually in a neutral position?
 
A neutral foot position simply means that when you’re standing, walking, or running, your feet are
straight. They aren’t pigeon-toed in or splayed out like a duck’s feet. They’re straight.
 
 
NEUTRAL, STRAIGHT FEET. This is the position you want to use as much as
you can throughout the day.
 
DUCK FEET. This position leads to an assortment of problems. Standing,
walking, and running with this sort of mechanical collapse is a habit that
will slowly eat you alive.
 
BIASED & UNBALANCED. This is an example of a lack of attention being
paid to a good standing position. One foot is flared outward, the other
neutral. Notice how the pelvic girdle tilts.
 
KEY MOTIV
ATION
By maintaining your feet in a neutral position while standing, walking, and running, you’re setting the
stage for efficient movement, defined as the way your body was engineered to move. And when you
move your body in the way it was intended to move, you reduce the stresses that lead to injuries and
worn-out joints.
 
BRIEFING
In essence, running is a series of jumps. With each jump, your foot makes contact with the ground; this
is known as a foot strike. And in that instant, your body seeks stability. It has to be stable, or you’ll
fall.
 
The neutral position, in which your feet are straight and parallel to one another, is the most stable
position for your feet. It’s the way your musculoskeletal system was intended to land on the ground
when you’re running.
recommended mobility exercises for neutral feet
 
Neutral feet start in your trunk, so really go after those tight hips:
 
 
Couch Stretch (see here)
Adductor Smash (see here)
Anterior Hip Smash (see here)
Hamstring Floss (see here)
Double-Band Hip Distraction (see here)
Global Gut Smash (see here)
Glute Smash & Floss (see here)
Hip Capsule Rotation (see here)
 
Let’s take a look at what happens when you don’t land with a neutral foot. Say your foot lands with
an inward slant—pigeon-toed, in other words. Your system then needs to make specific compromises
in your mechanics to generate the stability you need. Those compromises typically take a toll on your
joints and the connective tissues of those joints. Run frequently enough with poor mechanics like
these, and things will begin to wear out.
 
The neutral, stable foot position is a ready-for-action position that puts your body at its highest
capacity for performance. It is at its most powerful when you also adopt a braced neutral spine,
meaning that you are squeezing your glutes (often referred to as activating your hips) and your belly is
tight. The tight belly pulls your ribcage down slightly so that your trunk is energized into a single unit.
The final piece of a neutral spine is that your head is in alignment with your spine.
How do you make a habit of standing, walking, and running with neutral feet? Start by simply
aligning your feet throughout the day, like tucking in your shirt or washing your hands. Run small spot
checks throughout the day. Are your feet straight? If not, adjust them into a neutral position. Is your
spine neutral? If not, take a breath and organize your spine, starting by squeezing your glutes and belly
and then aligning your ribcage and head.
As I’ll show you with the drills you’ll use to work toward this standard, it starts with organizing
your lower spine and clearing up any soft-tissue problems that might be working against you. But this
standard is mostly about constant vigilance. Maintaining a neutral foot and spine position throughout
the day cannot be an afterthought.
Adopting the neutral foot standard is simple, but it requires daily practice. It’s the first step in
assuming responsibility for the health of your feet—and breaking away from the idea that to be able to
run throughout your life, all you need to do is sneak in a daily workout and outsource the injury
problems to whatever your health insurance will cover. This is also the beginning of your freedom
from the mistaken idea that a new pair of running shoes is an effective form of medical intervention.
Modern living is unkind when it comes to developing and maintaining neutral feet, with the myriad
muscles, bones, and connective tissues empowered and activated into the steel springs that your
arches were designed to be.
Long periods of sitting that atrophy your joints and muscles; shoes that jack up your
heels and weaken your heel cords; the rolled-shoulders and slumped-head position
that so many people adopt: These are just a few of the debilitating practices that work
together to weaken your feet and collapse your arches.
 
Long periods of sitting that atrophy your joints and muscles; shoes that jack up your heels and
weaken your heel cords; the rolled-shoulders and slumped-head position that so many people adopt to
read Facebook posts on their phones: These are just a few of the debilitating practices that work
together to weaken your feet and collapse your arches, and that motivate runners to spend money on
new shoes, orthotics, or medical care in the hopes that they will fix the problem.
Often, the money spent on trying to remedy the issue—the latest $150 running shoe combined with
an over-the-counter arch support or an additional heel lift—may offer temporary relief. The runner
can run again, or evade pain long enough to persevere through a goal marathon or ultramarathon. But a
shoe designed to restrict natural foot motion only serves to deepen the problem. A dependency on
running shoes, orthotics, ibuprofen, and heel-striking (see here) to maintain a weekly running mileage
is why injury rates for runners remain at epidemic levels and why so many runners have been
permanently sidelined to reading magazines while toiling away on an elliptical machine.
In other words, the high-tech running shoe intervention acts like a cast, rendering lifeless the
incredible facilities of your feet. They erode, atrophy, and weaken. The steel springs that your feet
were meant to be, with all the remarkable elasticity that is critical to running fast, running long, and
enjoying a lifetime of running, rusts away.
Is the stability running shoe a solution?
How much is spent on running shoes in the United States? Three billion dollars a year. That’s big
money—a big investment in technology and a lot of computer modeling and fussing around with EV
A
foam, special cushioning, and stabilizing gadgets embedded into the midsole, all with an undertow of
promises. As Christopher McDougall points out in his book Born to Run, the motion-control and
stability technologies offered in today’s running shoes can create more problems than they solve.
 
Here’s a quick primer on how running shoes are typically categorized and marketed. There are
three main divisions: cushioning shoes, stability shoes, and motion-control shoes. The template that
has been in place since the 1980s is that you pick a shoe based on the amount of pronation you exhibit
—how much your foot collapses inward on the foot strike. Certain running shoe stores and physical
therapy clinics use some form of gait analysis and may watch you run or videotape you on a treadmill.
If you are categorized as a mild pronator, you are advised to buy a cushioned shoe. If you’re
somewhere between being a mild pronator and being a severe pronator, you’re matched with a
stability shoe. If you’re a real clunker of a pronator, they bring out the boat-like, super-stiff shoes that
have been forebodingly engineered for “motion control.”
(As I’ll report in the next chapter, massive studies performed by the U.S. Army have shown that
this model of matching runners with running shoes doesn’t work at all.)
Overbuilt running shoes, costing small fortunes, tend to be the worst. The heel cushion the size of
an ice cream sandwich? The patented plastic stability system baked into the EV
A foam? This is more
about the science of marketing than any valid science of injury prevention.
Wait a minute, you might be thinking. Y
ou mean that all the talk we hear about the arms race that
exists between running shoe companies in trademarked technologies—motion-control devices,
stability features, rear-foot control design, foot bridges, and so on—there’s no valid injury
prevention research behind it?
No, there isn’t. There’s no research to support the industry model that is marketed to you—that if
you choose the right shoe for “your” foot with the right orthotics for “your” arch, run on the right
surfaces, and change those shoes every 500 miles, you’ll be healthier for it and avoid grinding away
cartilage and shredding tendons.
The underlying marketing principle propelling this model boils down to this:
The motion of running is so dangerous that you always have to be on the right surface and in the
right shoe.
This belief helps generate that $3 billion per year in running shoe sales. Yet the injury rate
continues its march, to the tune of almost all runners getting injured at least once a year.
Are you okay with that?
 
The arch: A fundamental misunderstanding
 
 
Contrary to long-held beliefs, the arch of the foot is a non-weight-bearing surface. The idea that
ligaments stretch out and the arch collapses buys into the misconception that the arch needs to be held
up by something else. I am pro-orthotic in about .001 percent of patients who have them. If you are
part of this .001 percent, it’s because you are so destroyed that it hurts even to stand.
 
The arch of the foot is more than ligaments connecting bony structures. It is really a combination of
arches: the medial longitudinal arch, lateral longitudinal arch, and anterior transverse arch—
analogous to a suspension bridge or a leaf spring in a car.
Why would a $150 motion-control shoe be of any value? You don’t seen any struts posts or
structures supporting any of the arches that hold up bridges, right?
Exactly. The right choice is to revive the natural technologies you were born with. This begins with
adhering to the Neutral Feet standard.
Achieving neutral feet
The first order of business is mindfulness. Right now, stand up and run a check on the position of your
feet. They should be straight and parallel to one another, shoulder width apart, and directly under your
hips. This is the neutral foot position. The objective of this standard is not simply to adopt this
position while you run, but to adopt it at all times.
 
When your feet are in a neutral position and you supply your entire system with torque by squeezing
your butt, which rotates your hips, you can run, jump, sprint, land, lift, and move with more power.
You also turn on your arches. In this position, your feet are at their most stable, and you’re prepared
to move safely.
the truth about barefoot power, high heels, and flip-flops
 
Both flip-flops and high-heeled shoes create artificial stiffness in the ankle, and the wearer begins to
walk as if she has stiff ankles, with her feet turned out. Walking through collapsed arches and around
the big toe results in destroyed arches, undue torsion forces on the plantar fascia, oblique loading on
the heel cords, impinged ankles, big bunions, and valgus knees. (Read more about the flip-flops
problem here.)
 
Look at cultures that go barefoot, and you see beautiful arches and strong feet. In cultures that
habitually wear flip-flops, you see the nightmare described above. The Hawaiians even have a name
for it: “island feet.” Flip-flops are banned in our gym; we don’t let our athletes wear them. We have
solved countless cases of knee pain in our clinic simply by removing the flip-flop.
Your ankles and feet are hidden pools of physical reserve. Don’t go wasting them. Want to see how
ridiculous flip-flops really are? Run a quick 400 in them. I’ll wait. Yeah, I know. You can’t run at all.
(Frankenstein slipper-shuffling isn’t running.)
Mr. Miyagi was right: “Best defense, no be there.”
 
Brace yourself
To light up the neutral foot position with power from your trunk, you need to make sure that the power
switch is turned to the on position. To do so, perform the bracing sequence.
 
Why the bracing sequence? Spinal positions can be divided into three types:
 
What you want to cultivate, both in your daily life and in your athletic training, is a neutral spine.
This is an invaluable discipline for a runner, and, given the variety of movement patterns involved,
even more so for a CrossFitter who runs or a football player who runs and also gets periodically
slammed.
 
If you make a daily habit of maintaining neutral feet and a neutral spine (or “midline”), this
foundational position will translate to your running. The benefits of midline stabilization go far
beyond simply protecting you from lower back pain and injury. It also serves as the primary link in
the flow of power through what is known as the posterior chain—the large, powerful muscles of the
back, hips, hamstrings, and calves. When you run in a neutral position, the power flows, and you have
the opportunity for greater activation and use of the large muscles of your hips and hamstrings.
When you’re running in a broken position, either in overextension or in a rounded-back state of
flexion, the link is broken. The posterior chain is effectively shut down, making you vulnerable to an
assortment of injuries. All of a sudden, you’re like the Starship Enterprise in Romulan territory, and
you’ve turned off the shields.
The first step toward embracing the benefits of midline stabilization is to learn the bracing
sequence. Periodically making sure that you are standing, walking, and running with neutral feet, as
well as practicing a neutral spine, is what I call “building your training into your day.” As you go
about your life—work, family responsibilities, errands, chores—you can be training to be a better
runner, a better athlete, or a better CrossFitter. You just need to make it a part of your ongoing routine.
The more you practice it in the 23 hours a day that you’re not running or working out, the more likely
you are to do it during your workout.
Try the following sequence barefoot to get a sense of how it connects the trunk stability generated
in your torso through the arches of your feet. Most of the time, sloppy foot positions are expressions
of a sloppy spine position. A simple execution of the bracing sequence will draw you into good
position.
Again, do the bracing sequence often throughout the day—so often that you don’t even think about it
anymore. Follow these steps:
 
 
1. Squeeze your butt the way a ballet dancer does, activating your glutes. This will set your
pelvis in a neutral position.
2. To pull your ribcage down into a neutral position, breathe in through your diaphram, tighten
your abs, and then slowly exhale. Imagine that your pelvis and your ribcage are two large
bowls filled to the top with water. Y
ou want them both balanced so that neither spills a drop.
Use your ab muscles to lock in the positions of your pelvis and ribcage. Squeezing your
glutes provides the foundation for this position, and tightening your abs locks it all together.
3. Set your head in a neutral position, and then extend your arms out to the sides and pull
your shoulders back into external rotation. With a balanced pelvis and ribcage, align your
ears with your shoulders and hips. Y
our gaze is forward, and your hips, shoulders, and head
are in a neutral position. This completes the picture. Now dial it all down to about 20
percent power. Maintaining a neutral position for your spine, shoulders, and head, take this
out into the world with you by relaxing all the squeezing energy from a full effort to about
a quarter effort. With practice, you can make this 20 percent engagement part of your
normal ready state. (At his CrossFit Endurance seminar, Brian MacKenzie teaches athletes
to run with 35 percent of the core turned on, with no negative effect on breathing.)
The benefits? Support for your spine that opens up the vast channel of power within your posterior
chain that is waiting to be tapped. You become more durable and more efficient, and you prioritize the
larger muscles over the smaller muscles, which equates to more endurance and stamina. While it’s
relatively easy to burn out your hip flexors (see Chapter 8), your glute muscles can just keep going
and going and going.
do you walk like a duck?
 
 
When your feet are turned out duck-style, stability bleeds away. With each step, your body has to
work extra hard to compensate for the loss. The arch of your foot flattens out, your knee caves in, you
lose power, and stresses on the soft tissues of your joints begin to pile up.
 
Keep your eyes open in the park or at a race and watch the duck-footed runners carefully. Watch
what happens when their feet strike the ground. Observe the path of their ankles and knees. This is
what you’ll see: The feet are splayed outward. As the force of gravity goes to work on the body mass,
the arches collapse, the ankles cave inward, and the knees follow the same path. This inward system
collapse against the midline of the body is a deformity known as a valgus movement.
This oblique load, falling through a compromised skeletal system, exerts shearing forces through
your joints and their soft tissues. Also, when your feet are turned out, your quad ligament gets pulled
off axis and is no longer perpendicular to your kneecap—an essential point of alignment. Multiply
these twisting forces by the number of steps you take in a 4-mile run, or a 10-mile run, or a marathon,
or a year of running. Does it come as any surprise that runners cultivate medical problems like
Achilles tendinopathy and patella tendinitis?
 
Runner to Runner
 
One of the compound exercises that is widely prescribed for runners is the back squat. This isn’t a
new phenomenon. In the 1994 book Training Distance Runners, by David Martin and Peter Coe, a
great American cross-country runner of the time, eight-time national champion Pat Porter, is
photographed doing barbell squats. Porter (who tragically was killed in a plane crash in 2012) was
skinny looking, even for a 10,000-meter Olympian, which is saying something. The first time I saw
him run in person, the word spider came to mind. Yet he was a ferocious and gutsy front-runner type
who had become part of the lore of Alamosa, Colorado, where he lived and trained through the 1980s
under the charismatic tutelage of Dr. Joe Vigil, the great exercise physiologist and coach who later
became a star character in Christopher McDougall’s bestseller Born to Run. At any rate, Porter is
pictured in the classic running book deep into a barbell squat.
 
I first did squats with a loaded barbell in high school in my football days. I can tell you right now
that my technique was probably not only bad, but dangerous. I recall purposefully caving in my knees
because I felt like I could generate more power that way. Just as bad and possibly worse is that I
never braced my lower spine before attempting a squat.
As the years went on, I occasionally revisited squatting for distance running, probably inspired by
that picture of Pat Porter. I always seemed to be on the verge of some catastrophic injury, so
eventually I let them go.
In working with Kelly Starrett and Brian MacKenzie on the overhaul of my running life, two of the
first things I learned were how to squat safely and how to brace my spine and keep it braced—not just
for squats, but also for standing, sitting, walking, and running.
It was odd at first, particularly working to maintain a braced spine while running. The breathing
took some time to figure out, and, at first, anyway, holding the brace seemed to take considerable
energy.
But there’s no going back after you’ve practiced it awhile. If I let those muscles go, I can feel the
vulnerabilities of the unbraced spine creeping back in. I can also feel the power connection between
my core and my legs slip away.
Another valuable upshot of adopting a braced neutral spine is this: When you do perform squats
using good technique (which you’ll learn in Chapter 7), it makes a huge difference in protecting your
spine. The heavier the weight, the more you’ll notice. Despite all my years of running plenty of miles
with weak mechanics that brought with them a history of lower back problems, I can squat with loads
well over my body weight without the slightest sketchy sensation. And my back has never felt
healthier and stronger.
The bracing sequence is why.

CHAPTER 5
STANDARD #2: FLAT SHOES
Q: Do you wear flat shoes?
 
This standard is as uncomplicated as it is robustly effective: When you wear shoes, wear the flat
kind. If you’re walking the red carpet on Oscar night, fine, go ahead and wear a shoe with a heel.
Once in a while is okay. But most of the time, you should wear shoes that are flat and won’t throw
your biological movement hardware into disarray. When you have to wear shoes, whether it’s running
shoes, work shoes, or combat boots, buy the flat kind, also known as having “zero drop”—meaning
that the heel is not raised above the forefoot. What you want to avoid, or wean yourself away from,
are shoes with the heels raised higher off the ground than the forefeet.
 
 
KEY MOTIV
ATION
It may seem like a minor deviation that your running shoes (for instance) have half an inch more
cushion under the heel than the forefoot, but this seemingly minor tweak is like messing with the
springs on a race car. It screws up the whole system, and at some point, the wheels are going to burn
off.
 
Consider the null hypothesis in regard to shoes, feet, and running. The null hypothesis refers to who
in a debate about medical treatment shoulders the burden of proof. It takes into account what the
default position or situation is. In regard to running, the default position for your feet is to be barefoot.
So those who insist that a running shoe should have an elevated heel and be loaded with stability
technology to restrict motion, and maybe an orthotic, too, have to prove that being barefoot is a
broken state that requires fixing.
You’re going to have to wear shoes because you work in an office or you walk or run on a
sidewalk, which is provably dangerous if you don’t have thick calluses on your feet. You want a shoe
that protects your foot from rocks and broken glass and/or allows you not to get written up by HR, yet
allows your foot to function as naturally as possible.
BRIEFING
When you run, do you land on your heels? If you do, then it’s fair to assume that you’re wearing a
running shoe that has a big, fat chunk of cushion under the heel. This shoe effectively jacks your heel
up higher off the ground than your forefoot.
 
recommended mobility exercises for neutral feet
 
Don’t just put on a pair of minimalist shoes. Help bring your feet and arches back to life with these
exercises:
 
 
Plantar Mobilizations (see here)
Toe Grip (see here)
Toe Re-animator (see here)
Calf Smash (see here)
 
Running shoe ads have long been deployed to show off how potent heel-cushion technology is (be
it air, gel, space-age rubber, or some honeycomb thing), and the photo of the runner in the ad is taken
right at the point of the heel’s impact with the ground. There’s a smile on the euphoric and skinny
runner’s face, even though her leg is snapped into full extension out in front of her body, jamming her
calcaneus into the concrete, buffered by the pillow of cushion injected into the compression-molded
midsole. What would be great is to have a physicist take a scientific calculator to the image and
extrapolate how much in the way of braking forces are shock-waving their way through the runner’s
skeleton and transmitting various shearing forces to the soft tissues within her joints, then take that
data and multiply it by the number of steps taken in a mile and the number of miles run in a week,
month, or year, and graph that data against the number and severity of injuries incurred by this runner.
So there’s controversy—some say that the runner in this picture is heel-striking. And what of it? It’s
the natural way she runs, isn’t it?
It isn’t. In fact, I promise that if you had her take off the shoes and run 100 meters down a sidewalk,
the heel-striking would vaporize instantly. She wouldn’t be landing on her heel or mid-foot; she
would be landing on her forefoot.
You were born to run, but you weren’t born to heel-strike when you run. Is there any gray area
here? No, there isn’t. Small children don’t heel-strike. Unfortunately, they are absorbed by a
dysfunctional system that we have long been warned about (see the sidebar “Shoes for Children”
here).
If you’re heel-striking, you have to stop. It’s eating you alive.
If you’re heel-striking when you run, you have to stop. It’s eating you alive.
 
From what I’ve observed, you don’t start seeing kids heel-strike until about the first grade. Then it
starts kicking in—hours spent sitting at desks and wearing shoes with heels, setting them on a path
where the feet weaken, the arches collapse, and the heel cords shorten, robbing them of the natural
power of their feet. Want to do your children a big favor? Put them in flat shoes early on and keep
them there.
I’m not saying to wear shoes all the time. In fact, I want you and your family to embrace Barefoot
Saturday. One day a week, make a concerted effort to be barefoot as much as possible. As long as
you’re walking around in places where you know there’s no glass or debris that might harm your feet,
go barefoot. When you’re walking around the house or backyard is another good chance to safely be
barefoot and sneak in a session of secret training—a nice dose of strengthening and mobilizing your
feet.
Make a concerted effort to be barefoot as much as possible in order to strengthen and
mobilize your feet.
 
Nick Campitelli is a runner and podiatrist in Akron, Ohio, and publishes Dr. Nick’s Running Blog.
When Dr. Nick was going through podiatry school, he couldn’t help but look at it through the lens of a
distance runner, since injured runners rely on podiatrists to help keep them healthy and logging miles
on the road. Certain things he learned troubled him. For one, he couldn’t find a single thread of
research that supported building up the heel cushion in a running shoe over and above the forefoot—a
running shoe industry transition that started in the 1970s.
Back in the 1960s, everyone was running in flat shoes—Keds, Converse, Onitsuka (aka Asics)
Tigers. Then air cushions and the like began to get stuffed under the heel, but for no clear and
definitive reason that Campitelli could sort out. His best guess was that someone had some heel pain
and raised the heel to limit the pain, and then someone else thought, “Why don’t we do this with an
entire line of running shoes?” Whatever the reason, the change appears to have been driven by the
industry and by marketing, Campitelli says. The upshot of the change was this: As running boomed,
more and more heel-striking was enabled until heel-striking became standard.
But that doesn’t mean it’s right. Dr. Nick is unique in the podiatry world because when runners
come to see him with an injury, his solution never involves an orthotic. Rather, he targets the abductor
hallucis muscle, a muscle found on the medial side of the foot that has the unique and powerful job of
abducting the big toe. (Refer to the illustration here.) Dr. Nick’s focus in helping a runner reconstitute
his or her feet is slowly, patiently transitioning the runner from (for example) a big, honking motion-
control shoe implanted with a wickedly stiff orthotic into a minimalistic shoe that is flat and flexible
and lets the foot be a foot.
In the before-and-after photos taken of one of Dr. Nick’s patients, you can see the result of his
work. The photo on the left was taken when a 34-year-old woman runner came to see him for help.
She had motion-control shoes and orthotics that weren’t doing anything to prevent knee and back pain.
Notice how her heels are leaning inward, on the verge of collapse? Both her heels and her knees
were valgus. The motion-control-shoe-and-orthotic setup was supposed to realign her heels and the
rest of her skeleton with them. How did that work out for her?
It took two years, but after slowly introducing a zero-drop shoe to his patient, Dr. Nick let nature
take its course. As you can see in the photo on the right, the runner’s calcaneus has been resurrected
and is now practically vertical, restoring what was previously a collapsed arch. There was no use of
“corrective” orthotics or stiff-shanked shoes. As Campitelli says, it’s the simple product of a foot
being allowed to be a foot.
“This is not the direct result of simply wearing a minimalist shoe,” Campitelli says. “This is the
result of what happens when you stress the foot and let it work the way it was intended to and become
stronger.”

. Campitelli’s patient before and after
. In 2012, she was a complete shipwreck. But after patient
exposure to flat shoes and strengthening work, her arches and alignment were restored to original
manufacturer’s condition in 2014.
 
shoes for children
 
Barefoot Saturday—spending one day a week being barefoot as much as possible—is good both for
you and for your kids. In 1991, Dr. Lynn T. Staheli of the department of orthopedics at the Children’s
Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle published a review of shoes for children in Pediatrics, the
journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.8 “Some physicians believe that shoes are simply part
of the child’s clothing, while others believe that shoes are important therapeutic tools capable of
correcting deformity and preventing significant disability later in life,” she writes, introducing an
approach that “focuses on how the foot fares without shoes.”
 
Dr. Staheli summarizes the findings, which she describes as being “based on objective data rather
than impressions or tradition,” as follows:
 
 
1. Optimum foot development occurs in the barefoot environment.
2. The primary role of shoes is to protect the foot from injury and infection.
3. Stiff and compressive footwear may cause deformity, weakness, and loss of mobility.
4. The term “corrective shoes” is a misnomer.
5. Shock absorption, load distribution, and elevation are valid indications for shoe
modifications.
6. Shoe selection for children should be based on the barefoot model.
7. Physicians should avoid and discourage the commercialization and “media”-ization of
footwear. Merchandising of the “corrective shoe” is harmful to the child, expensive for the
family, and a discredit to the medical profession.
 
flip-flops? just say no
 
While barefoot, I want you to take a moment to appreciate one of the most vivid illustrations of how
your body is a system of systems and why one of the best things you can do for these elaborate, highly
evolved systems is to not screw them up.
 
Standing, look down at your right foot. Now watch and feel what happens when you slowly lift
your toes. The arch turns on, doesn’t it? Lifting the toes, especially the big toe, winds up the plantar
fascia. In the same way you use a windlass mechanism to crank up a bucket of water from a deep
well, your foot is a kind of biological winch, where the plantar fascia is the cable and the big toe is
the crank. The windlass effect is how one went about hoisting rocks hundreds of feet into the air in the
church construction business back in the fourteenth century. In your feet, the plantar fascia’s windlass
mechanics provide for an assortment of critical functions, according to Kevin Kirby, a professor of
applied biomechanics, including arch support, reducing shearing forces on the ligaments and
compression forces being fed into the joints, and absorbing elastic strain during the acts of running
and jumping.9
So what’s a great way to screw up your foot machines? Flip-flops. When you walk from point A to
B, you have to clench your big toe to keep the thing from slipping off. And when you clench the big
toe, the windlass system in your foot grinds to a halt, and your plantar fascia pays the price. The
tissues of the arch get gummed up and shortened, messing with all the properties the plantar fascia is
designed to deliver. The kink gets distributed through multiple systems, like a shortened heel cord to
entrapping the sciatic nerve, which corresponds to Achilles pathologies and neurodynamic aches and
pains. All because of flip-flops.
Sure, wear a pair of flip-flops in the shower room if you’re wary of fungus. But if you want to be
an athlete with full-on performance capacities, avoid them. They are the plague.
 
DROPPING DOWN TO ZERO
So you’ve been wearing heeled shoes all your life, you run in shoes with a 12mm drop, you lack
dorsiflexion, and you suffer the consequences of having a valgus calcaneus and valgus knee.
 
There is no overnight fix.
You have to pony up and understand that making this change is going to take time. Don’t be that guy
who runs 60 miles a week and chucks his $150 motion-control shoes with a 12mm drop for a pair of
zero-drop Vibrams and doesn’t want a single hiccup in the logbook. Your chances of being injured by
too much stress, too quickly, are high. Maybe certain.
But know this: Your feet have the power to change.
Here’s the protocol that Dr. Nick Campitelli recommends:
 
Choose a pair of minimalist shoes that you like. The shoe should allow you to be as close to
barefoot as you’re comfortable with. Look for zero drop and zero arch support.
Plan on a minimum of six to eight weeks to transition into your new shoes. Longer is fine.
Shorter is not. In the grand scheme of things, two months is not a big deal when it comes to your
running life.
Use the 10 percent rule. If you’re heading out for a 3-mile run, run one-third of a mile (10
percent of your total distance) at the beginning of your run in your new minimalist shoes. Then
change into whatever your regular shoe setup has been, orthotics and all. Why wear the
minimalist shoe at the beginning of your run? Because your feet are fresh.
Each week, increase the amount of time you spend running in your new minimalist shoes by
10 percent. Exercise caution throughout the process—listen to your feet. Add a week with no
change here and there if you need to.
A WORD ON WORK SHOES
Here’s a field trip assignment for you. Visit the mall at lunchtime on a weekday and hover around the
men’s shoe stores. Be on the lookout for the iconic businessman making a stop to bolster his
wardrobe. Does he fit the following description?
 
He wears a tailored dark suit and a pair of dress shoes. The shoes have the stylish configuration of
vamp, quarter, and heel cap, and beneath the heel cap is a firm, blocky heel, raising the rear of his
foot significantly above the plane of his forefoot. Watch the businessman stride around confidently—
striking out with long steps, eating up territory, forcefully heel-striking out in front of his body. You’ve
seen this before, and there’s a form of social power to the imagery. Notice how this style of
movement is enabled by the construction of the shoe.
Now that you’ve seen it, do the exact opposite and transition toward flat shoes—not just for
running and kicking around, but also for wearing to the office or job site. In progressing your foot
toward full work capacity, you want to effectively cancel out any time spent in a shoe that shortens
your tendons and kills off the range of motion that your foot was designed to wield.
want to control excessive pronation? train your abductor hallucis muscles
 
When it comes to running injuries, excessive pronation (inward rolling of the foot) is often
considered the guilty culprit. For years, the common answer has been to steer the injured runner into a
stability or motion-control shoe, along with an over-the-counter arch support or a custom-made
orthotic, to the tune of $100 or more. Is your foot overpronating? Then wear a stiff shoe that acts like
a brace on your foot, conventional wisdom says.
 
Here’s a different idea, one that’s ridiculously cheaper: Train your abductor hallucis muscles.
Essentially, the abductor hallucis originates from the heel bone and travels along the inside of the
foot, inserting at the base of your big toe. The work that the abductor hallucis does in support of your
arch is profound: It’s involved in the flexion and abduction of your big toe, the rotation of your tibia,
and the inversion of your heel (the calcaneus).10 Studies using electromyography have demonstrated
that this muscle plays a critical role in controlling pronation.11
But this happens only when your foot isn’t in a state of physical erosion. So, rather than further
weaken your foot with a shoe-brace contraption, commit to Barefoot Saturday, wear flat shoes when
you must wear shoes, and put in consistent mobility work to wake up and strengthen your toes.
 
The abductor hallucis muscle has the job of abducting the big toe. When it is strong and supple, this key
postural muscle brings your foot to life. By simply wearing flat shoes (and spending as much time as you can
barefoot), you will give your abductor hallucis muscles the workout they need and deserve.
 
 
Runner to Runner
 
Over the past 25 years of running, I have suffered a multitude of injuries around my Achilles tendon
area. My response was to ice it two or three times for a couple of days and then start stretching out
the ankle. At whatever point I resumed running (if I took any break at all), I inserted pads into the
heels of my running shoes. The shoe, it should be mentioned, often had a significantly built-up heel
over the height of the forefoot. I never even thought to address whatever sort of issue was the cause of
the injury.
 
Once when I was averaging 80 to 90 miles of running per week, my left Achilles flared in a
painfully tender way. Training slammed to a halt. My coach said, “One thing about high-mileage
running: If you have any mechanical problems, it will bring them to the surface.” A good analysis, but
unhelpful. I was desperate to resume my running program full bore. Perhaps a better decision would
have been to make ferreting out the mechanical issue my top priority. Such a choice might have
prevented the considerable bunion I have on my left heel.
Better late than never, I now address mechanical issues with running drills. I also mobilize with the
exercises outlined in Part 3 of this book, sliding surface work with a soft ball, and range of motion
work. The final part of the picture for me is wearing flat shoes. Given that I sought out fat, cushioned
heels in training shoes and wore running shoes in my daily life as well, the transition was a delicate
one. At first I would notice within 20 minutes a low-grade pain from the stress. More was being
asked of my heel cords. It took a couple of months of progressive exposure until I had adjusted to
wearing flat shoes all the time. The interesting thing to report is that putting on a pair of shoes that has
a high drop from heel to toe is weirdly uncomfortable for me now. I hate it. Flat shoes actually feel
better.

CHAPTER 6
STANDARD #3: A SUPPLE THORACIC SPINE
Q: Do you have a pliant, properly organized thoracic spine?
 
The 12 thoracic vertebrae of your middle back are not to be forgotten. While runners tend to think a
lot about the muscles and joints from the lower back down through the feet, the thoracic spine, or T-
spine, is crucial when it comes to being able to sustain a neutral position in your long-distance
running. If you haven’t given much thought to taking care of your middle back (when you run, sit,
walk, talk, type, text, breathe, and so on), then it’s time to start changing that today.
 
 
KEY MOTIV
ATION
While we hear a lot about how important “the core” is to running—the core typically being defined as
the bottom of the ribcage to mid-thigh or so, depending on who you’re listening to—be aware that if
your T-spine is tight and out of whack, then all the power that you’d like to have flowing from your
hard-earned six-pack and taut glute muscles is going to get squeezed off. A tight thoracic spine gums
up your posterior chain, and you can’t get your shoulders and head into a good, aligned position,
which transmits strain into your neck and lower back. It can also mess with your hip function, so
stresses will seep and creep their way into the usual suspects: knees, ankles, and feet. And the longer
you go in a run, the more your form disintegrates, and the uglier it gets.

BRIEFING
Every weekday morning in San Francisco, herds of high-tech workers line up at street corners,
waiting for the charter bus to swing by and load them up for their daily trip to Silicon V
alley. They
take their seats on the bus and jack into the Wi-Fi with their laptops, but you see them getting their
start while waiting for the bus, many of them hunched up, shoulder rolled, heads hanging out over the
cliff, at one with their iPhones, either reading or texting. They will spend the better part of the day
honing this ungodly position.
 
The modern runner is often the modern desk athlete. Unless you’re vigilant about your
positions, that’s a big problem.
 
They are not alone, of course. The modern runner is often the modern desk athlete. Unless you’re
vigilant about your positions, that’s a big problem. Of these two images, which sounds like it’s doing
more damage to the body?
 
A day laborer in India transporting bricks to a construction site in a basket perched on top
of her head.
A computer programmer hunched over his laptop with a 7-ounce baseball cap on his head.
For the sake of connection, let’s say he’s one of the tech workers waiting for the Google
bus on the corner of 18th and Dolores in San Francisco’s Mission District. He starts his day
with his head hanging over his phone, and then he climbs into a window seat on the bus and
spends the rest of the day caving his head and shoulders over a computer.
Let me put it this way: In this comparison, the woman in her sari carrying bricks is showing off the
power of midline stabilization. The programmer, on the other hand, is committing himself to a slow
and grisly death.
Say that programmer is training for a half-marathon. If he’s spending six, eight, or more hours a day
slouched over a screen of some kind, mastering what might be called the Pooping Dog position, do
you think it might translate through osmosis to how he runs?
One of the things that’s definitely going to happen is that, after he practices it for 40, 50, or more
hours a week, this broken position is going to feel very normal to him.
And this is what you’re going to see if you spend some time watching the hundreds of people run by
in a road race: rounded upper backs—which is an expression of a tight thoracic spine—with heads
jutting out in front of spines.
The consequences of a tight thoracic spine
What are the consequences of a tight thoracic spine and a broken upper body, neck, and head
position? Because the human body is a system of systems, the dysfunction is broadcast up and down
the kinetic chain and manifests itself in problems throughout the body:
 
 
Neck pain. When you see that head jutting out in front of the spine, consider that the head weighs
about 12 pounds on its own and that every inch it juts forward effectively adds another 10
pounds of weight to the problem.
Shoulder mobility problems. When your shoulder joints are in a neutral, externally rotated
position, you get the benefit of stored-up energy from rotational torque. With your shoulders
rolled forward, you give up all this torque. Your soft tissues have a lot more stress put on them,
and they have to stabilize the shoulder joints. As the woman who carries a basket full of bricks
on her head knows intuitively, an organized skeleton with the shoulders properly set in a neutral
position channels the power of structural support to stabilize the situation, whereas a poor
position grinds away at the soft tissues. Even though the deskbound distance runner isn’t carrying
a load on top of his head, if his posture is broken and midline stabilization is lost, his shoulders
are going to pay a price. Why would a runner have trouble getting his arms over his head? The
fact is that he shouldn’t.
Lower back pain. A tight, hunched thoracic spine shuts down the flow of power within the
body’s systems. In running, this translates to more stress being dumped on the lower back, or
lumbar section of the spine.
Knee pain. Without a neutral spine, stress on the knees increases. Now we’re in the territory of
some of the ailments that runners are more familiar with: piriformis pain (aka deep butt pain)
and any number of knee ailments that result from poor hip function.
Other hotspots. Again, the body is a system of systems. In my model, your trunk is the chassis
of your Formula 1 running machine. The two primary engines for power are the hips and
shoulders. A tight thoracic spine gums up stability and the flow of power. This invites any
number of kinks into the complex operation of stabilizing the body while running, including how
your foot strikes the ground. The result is pain. Feeling pain is a clear sign that you’re doing
something wrong.
Loss of power. This discussion isn’t just about pain. It’s also about power. Consider again that
your trunk is the chassis, and you have an engine in your hips and an engine in your shoulders. If
you run with your shoulders hunched forward and your head jutting out over your faulty upper
back position, you are bleeding away power.
A tight, hunched thoracic spine shuts down the flow of power within the body’s
systems.
 
If you have neck pain, or your shoulders roll forward because they are lacking external rotation, or
you have a problem downstream because there’s so much stress and weirdness going on in your
lower back and hips, then pay close attention to this standard. A supple, organized thoracic spine is
the place to start.
Achieving a supple thoracic spine
To get into good position, follow these steps:
 
Standing with a neutral spine, squeeze your shoulder blades together to
externally rotate your shoulders so that the joints are set properly.
Move your arms into a relaxed, 90-degree position, retaining neutral
midline stability and correct shoulder position.
THE DREADED ROLLED-SHOULDERS FAULT. This is what you don’t want to
look like. Notice that my shoulders are inwardly rotated right out of the
joint sockets. This is no way to run 10 miles.
In addition to practicing the bracing sequence (see here) throughout the day, use the mobilizations that
target the upper back (found see here–here) to breathe some air into your thoracic spine.
 
Runner to Runner
 
Upper body running form used to be an oxymoron for me. The stretching routine that I performed over
the years didn’t include a single move that attended to anything above my lower back. One of the
reasons I never thought about it was probably because I occasionally trained with a runner who had a
2:20 marathon to his credit, much faster than my PR. He hunched his shoulders in such a way when he
ran that his posture reminded me of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. I’ve known many good runners
over the years who run with their shoulders rolled over and inward and their backs hunched. It didn’t
seem to slow them down, either, so who cares? As it turns out, I care.
 
Another ailment that I picked up over the years was a pain in my neck, like having a long, thin
needle plunged into my upper spine. I would feel it when I ran or walked for a long time. Placing a
lacrosse ball on the tissue along my thoracic spine made a difference immediately. In addition to pain
management, I’ve learned (the hard way) that having a properly organized upper spine and shoulders
takes less energy. In other words, if the skeleton is allowed to do its job, less energy needs to be
expended by the muscles doing the work of keeping things stable and lifted.

CHAPTER 7
STANDARD #4: AN EFFICIENT SQUATTING TECHNIQUE
Q: Can you squat correctly?
 
This standard is about good hip function and good ankle function. Being able to perform a deep squat
using good movement patterns, with proper hip function—and having a visceral understanding of
what these patterns are—is foundational in being Ready to Run. Achieving this standard also means
being able to perform a sequence of good squats under a small dose of metabolic load.
 
There are two tests involved with this standard:
 
Can you perform a squat with good technique, using the patterns your body is designed to
squat with?
Can you maintain a minimum of 10 good, clean air squats within the Tabata interval
protocol; meaning, can you maintain a pace of 10 good air squats in 8 consecutive periods
of 20 seconds, with 10 seconds of rest after each period?
KEY MOTIV
ATION
Being able to squat well is the foundation of good movement patterns that enable you to access power
from your posterior chain and protect you from injury. Meeting this standard will translate to proper
hip function and an understanding of what good mechanics feel like.
 
recommended mobility exercises for efficient squatting
 
The best way to improve your squat is, believe it or not, to do a lot of squats and spend time in a deep
squatting position. Also bias these mobilizations:
 
 
Couch Stretch (see here)
Banded Ankle Mob (see here)
Posterior Chain Banded Floss (see here)

downs/)
 
BRIEFING
You’ve probably heard that most runners have “weak hips.” Another description is that the glutes
“aren’t firing” or are “shut down” or “imbalanced.” Here’s a performance motivator for you:
Analyzing, fixing, and developing your squatting ability will reward you with the ability to activate
your all-powerful glutes when you run and open up a clean flow of hip drive into your running. Have
you experienced that run where you have a lot of pop off the ground and feel like you’re flying? That’s
hip drive.
 
Also: Do you want to expose any dysfunction in your mechanics that may be grinding you up with
chronic injury? There’s no more direct and effective way to illuminate your movement problems than
squatting. And that’s not all. As famed running coach and author Dr. Jack Daniels will tell you, the
threat of running injury increases when you fatigue in a run or race and your mechanics go to hell.
Would some insight into how you hold up a good pattern be of any use to you? Knowledge is
power, so glean even more information by adding a dose of endurance stress to your squat testing.
This helps you get your mind around what’s mangled or missing in the movement patterns that are
fundamental to your running performance and your running health. Good movement patterns should be
in place at the beginning of a run and should look the same at the finish. As a bonus, knowing how to
squat well is going to make you a better, more functional person—you won’t have to wave off your
neighbor when she asks if you can help move a sofa bed because you’re afraid that you’ll get hurt.
You’ll be better able to climb and descend stairs like a healthy person as opposed to a broken runner
who navigates steps like land mines.
Some years ago, a top American middle-distance runner had qualified to run the 1,500 meters in
the World Championships. The times he was producing in the summer racing season indicated that he
had a chance to medal. But he never made the trip to Worlds. Why? Because one day he was mowing
the lawn and threw his back out.
This is what I’m talking about. Being a runner shouldn’t mean that you can’t lift a box or push a
baby stroller without the threat of a season-ending injury. Developing and mastering your squat will
give both your running and your life a boost.
The following two squat tests will serve you well as a diagnostic tool and will help guide you with
your ongoing mobility work.
Being a runner shouldn’t mean that you can’t lift a box or push a baby stroller without
the threat of a season-ending injury. Developing and mastering your squat will give
both your running and your life a boost.
Test #1: A good, basic air squat
To check your squatting mechanics, set up your phone or a camera to shoot video, or have a friend
give you some real-time feedback. Your task is to do a squat with your hips dropping below your
knees and then return to the starting position. You must achieve the following technique specifics:
 
 
 
1. Stand with your feet just outside your shoulders—the classic power stance in athletics.
Imagine that you’re going to do a standing long jump, or you’re getting into position to chase
after a tennis serve from V
enus Williams. Position your feet straight or slightly open. Slightly
open is okay—but just slightly. A duck-footed stance, with your toes pointing too far outward, is
a fault. Pigeon-toed inward is also a fault.
2. Activate your butt and posterior chain. With your feet straight, turn on the muscles of your
posterior chain—from your arches to your hamstrings, hips, and muscles supporting your trunk—
by pretending that you are screwing two dinner plates into the ground with your feet. Your left
foot exerts rotational energy in a counterclockwise direction, and your right foot in a clockwise
direction. Extend your arms forward as a measure of counterbalance before you descend into the
squat.
 
3. Drive your knees outward. Cue yourself to keep your heels on the ground and drive your knees
outward to prevent any debilitating inward (valgus) knee movement.
4. Drop your hips below the plane of your knees without extending your knees over your feet.
Notice the depth of my squat. Your air squat needs to be deep enough that the hip crease at the
front of your leg drops below the plane of your knees.
 
5. Keep your knees from extending over your feet. Notice from the side how my knees don’t
break the vertical line that could be drawn upward from my toes. Leaching your knees out over
your feet is a big fault to look out for. If you keep your shins vertical, you can unload stress from
your knees and use your hips and hamstrings to do the work for the squat. V
ertical shins enable
you to take advantage of all that safe power and stability that the posterior chain can provide.
What you don’t want to see are your knees driving out over and in front of your feet, with your
shins breaking the vertical line. With that break comes shear and stress-wreaking havoc on your
knees. If you see that you’re making this fault, redo the squat with vertical shins, focus on
loading your hips and hamstrings, and notice how little toll a deep squat takes on your knees. If
you’re doing it right, they will breeze through it.
Also take note of the flat back. Before beginning and throughout the execution of the squat,
your glute and ab muscles should be active so that they can maintain a strong, neutral spine and a
flat back. You should have a tightened midline, in other words. If you let these muscles go soft,
the power flow of the posterior chain goes dead, and your squat will be “broken.” Keep a good,
flat back throughout the squat to pass this part of the test.
6. Hang out in the squat position. How do you develop mobility for a better squat? The same
mobility that will reward you with better hip function for your running? By spending time in the
squat position. I encourage athletes to collect 10 or more minutes a day in the squat position.
7. Use a support. If you’re coming into this standard with weak, tight hips, shorted heel cords, and
other mobility and strength restrictions, use a pole as a support to collect minutes in a deep squat
position.
 
FAULT: valgus knees. A common fault for runners performing the air squat test is that their knees
collapse inward into a valgus position, as shown above. The valgus position is a fault in which
(especially under the load of a weighted barbell) you can practically see smoke coming out of the
knees as the soft tissues burn. Watch your knees carefully. Just as they should not extend out in front of
your feet, they should not collapse inward. Keep an eye on the arches of your feet as well—they
should stay turned on as opposed to collapsing inward.
 
 
FAULT: duck feet. Duck feet are what typically lead to the valgus
knee fault. In addition to driving your knees outward throughout the
squat, be sure you use neutral feet as a preventative measure.
Test #2: The ability to do a lot of good squats when fatigued
You may have the ability to meet this standard easily right out of the gate, but I encourage you to check
in with it frequently. It will help you keep an eye on things throughout the year and through the various
fluctuations that might impact your training. Like if you ramp things up for a marathon. Or work goes
off the rails. This is like a smog test. It will also give you a quick, no-impact workout, for whatever
that’s worth.
 
I started using the Tabata squat test as a marker for rehab with patients recovering from ACL
surgery. In a compressed period, it reveals a lot about motor control patterns and range of motion in
the ankle and hip. You definitely want to shoot video to see how you move under the duress of
metabolic load. It makes the invisible visible.
Having or developing the capacity to do a good squat is a great start in meeting this standard. Not
only do I want you to be able to do one correctly, but I want to encourage you to understand all the
working parts of a good squat and what they feel like. Why? Because this knowledge will translate to
how you monitor your running form.
My Tabata squat test for this standard is based on the Tabata interval protocol, following a series
of 8 short, 20-second intervals and even shorter 10-second rests. Within each minute of a 4-minute
period, you will perform two 20-second bouts of work, each followed by a 10-second breather.
This is a killer tool for exposing weaknesses in a safe environment. Tabata squats quickly
introduce fatigue into the picture, but no one is going to get injured. Range of motion problems will
surface, and by the end you’ll see if you’re favoring one side or the other.
 
This is also a killer tool for netting a universal feel for how to load your hips and hamstrings.
To achieve the squatting standard, you must do the following after a thorough warm-up: Perform a
minimum of 10 quality air squats in every 20-second interval in a 4-minute workout. If you can do
more than 10, that’s great, but to achieve this standard, your count of good squats in each work
interval should never drop below 10.
Understanding the working parts of a good squat and what they feel like will translate
to how you monitor your running form.
 
It looks like this:
 
1. Do a thorough warm-up. This is considered a high-intensity workout, so warm up
accordingly with air squats, jumping rope, burpees, push-ups, and mobility exercises. Y
ou
should be hot and sweaty when you start the Tabata test.
2. Set up a video camera (or a friend or training partner) and a clock or timer. The work
intervals and rest intervals come fast and furious, so be sure that you know when to squat
and when to rest.
3. Keep your feet straight throughout the session. Be on the lookout for your feet wanting to
turn outward. If they do, those squats don’t count.
4. Begin the first 20-second work interval. Fire off good squats and start counting them.
Perform as many quality squats as you can in 20 seconds.
5. Rest for 10 seconds. One of the things you’ll figure out fast is that 10 seconds goes by
quickly. Grab some air and be ready to execute another round of good squats.
6. Repeat this pattern for 4 minutes, counting the number of squats you do in each interval. If
you break any of the rules of proper technique—like allowing your knees to cave inward or
tracking your knees out over and beyond your feet—that rep doesn’t count. Only good
reps count.
If you can do at least 10 passable squats in each interval, you have achieved this standard. Work
toward more! Go for 15 or more squats per interval and bake a good squat pattern into your body.
 
Runner to Runner
 
The strength programs I recall seeing in the 1980s and ’90s usually recommended the following
moves: knee extensions, hamstring curls, calf raises, and quarter squats on the leg press. There was a
terrific aversion to the idea of a deep squat. As Kelly points out in a number of his range of motion
recommendations, he does not advocate any hypermobile positions. Normal is what he’s asking for.
The same applies to the squat. If you can squat only a quarter of the way down, you’re missing out on
a huge swath of range that is key to simply being healthy.
 
From what I’ve learned in recent years, coaches may have settled on the quarter-range squat as
being the safe squat simply because if you do the squat wrong—with your knees extending out over
your feet and/or caving inward—then all the stress lands in the wrong spot: your knees. If you load
your hips and hamstrings by lowering into a squat properly, you can feel the difference: There is
practically zero stress on your knees. The power is being generated by the large muscles of your hips.
These muscles are so large that they seem virtually inexhaustible. I’ve now performed workouts that
include 300 squats, each requiring that I lower my hips beneath the plane of my knees. The major
stress is on my lungs—you can bang these reps out by the dozen, and what slows you down is not the
breakdown of muscle, but the amount of blood and oxygen required to feed them. I do squats every
week now in one form or another, and as ironic as it might seem to coaches who say that runners
shouldn’t squat because it’s too dangerous, I do them for the opposite reason: If I go a couple of
weeks without squat work, my posture gets sloppy and my hip function suffers. I need the squats to
prevent the kinds of injury pain that used to bite me all the time.

CHAPTER 8
STANDARD #5: HIP FLEXION
Q: Can you stand on your left leg and express normal range of hip flexion with
your right hip for 30 seconds, then repeat with your right leg and left hip?
 
In the quest for optimal hip function, a normal amount of hip flexion is required. As testing for this
standard will surely reveal, many runners fall far short of meeting the requirement of balanced,
powerful hip function. If you train frequently, run frequently, and/or spend a significant amount of time
sitting each day, your tissues can shorten and rob you of a normal degree of hip flexion, which in turn
deteriorates your overall hip function. Power loss and the potential for injury go up.
 
In the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, the conventional thinking was that running injuries were directly
associated with the feet. But this tide began to turn when researchers began to study hip function.
Research conducted in 2002—comparing 30 runners suffering from chronic injuries with 30 runners
who were healthy—looked at the level of strength and balance of six different muscles groups in the
hips.12 One of the things the researchers noted was that the injured runners had weak hip flexors and
abductors.
That was just the beginning. Since then, research tracing injuries and excessive pronation to weak,
tight hips has piled up.
If you’re in the midst of trying to learn a new running technique, like the Pose Method, you’ll want
to attend to all of the standards related to hip function—squatting, hip flexion, hip extension, and
ankle range of motion—to safely facilitate the change.
KEY MOTIV
ATION
Developing and/or maintaining proper hip flexion contributes to the healthy hip function, which
will enable you to run with good form and balance and channel power from your posterior chain.

Glute Smash & Floss (see here)
Hamstring Smash (see here) and Floss (see here)
 
BRIEFING
One of the benefits of possessing normal range of motion and function in your hips is that it makes it a
lot easier to move from one good position to another good position.
 
A good way to think of running is the way suggested by Dr. Nicholas Romanov, creator of the Pose
Method. When gravity has brought you into contact with the ground in the midst of a foot strike, your
body is in a “pose.” You want to be in the best pose, or position, possible in terms of your lean, your
posture, and the physics of where your body mass is in relationship to gravity. What follows is the
movement to your next foot strike and a new pose on the opposite foot.
Put on your physicist’s cap and think about all the various forces involved, in particular what goes
into achieving stability in each new position of balancing on one leg, over and over and over. If it
sounds easy, it isn’t. Just ask any robotics engineer who’s tried to build a machine that walks like a
human.
Since I am mad for performance, I want you to seek the positions and motor patterns that lead to
increased efficiency and minimize negative stresses.
To facilitate optimal patterns of movement in your running, you really need your hips in business
and firing all thrusters. When you’re running, a lack of hip extension or hip flexion forces you to make
mechanical compromises downstream to generate the stability you need as you shift from pose to
pose.
I address hip extension in Chapter 9. This standard addresses hip flexion.
Wait a second, you might think. Aren’t I practicing hip flexion all the time when I sit in my Aeron
chair?
You sure are. In fact, our bodies tend to mold themselves into the positions in which we spend the
most time. If you spend hours every day in the sitting position, indeed, you’re in a state of hip flexion.
Our bodies tend to mold themselves into the positions in which we spend the most
time.
 
Unfortunately, the hip flexion that occurs when you sit in a chair is short of the range needed to
fulfill what the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) calls normal. If you’re sitting up
straight and tall, you’re at 90 degrees. That’s about 30 degrees short of where you need to be. If
you’re slumping in the chair, borrow your kid’s protractor and see for yourself how short you’re
coming up. Short is a good word—being in the sitting position creates shortness in the hip capsule
and the associated tissues of the hip, like the psoas.
The AAOS says that 120 degrees gets you a passing grade of normal.
death by sitting: your counterattack
 
Super ultramarathoner Dean Karnazes has managed to run across the country, run on a treadmill for
two days straight, and finish epic races like the 135-mile Badwater Ultramarathon many times over.
Injuries? Dean doesn’t have time for injuries. One of his secrets, he says, is this:
 
“I rarely sit down.”
Rather, Dean cultivates a habit of using a standing desk for his time on the computer and keeps the
amount of time he spends sitting to an extreme minimum. He even breaks up his time standing at his
computer with occasional blasts of air squats, push-ups, and pull-ups.
Not all of us are in a position to abandon the chair in favor of a standing desk. If that’s the boat
you’re sailing on, use the bracing sequence (see here) to help set yourself for sitting with a braced
neutral spine.
Every 15 minutes or so, get up out of your chair, shake things out, and go through the bracing
sequence. With your pelvis reset and your spine organized, keep your butt and ab muscles on at about
20 percent tension and resume your seat.
NOTE: There’s no shortcut for the bracing sequence. If you find yourself slumping in your chair,
there’s no effective way to recapture a braced neutral spine while seated. Pop up to your feet and
redo your bracing sequence. Do it throughout your day, and over time you will have blown back tons
of muscle-shortening damage that sitting would normally do to you.
 
In the test for this standard, I want you to accomplish a couple of different things:
 
Y
ou will perform the test while standing in order to test your functionality with a small dose
of load and balance work.
Y
ou need to be able to demonstrate normal flexion in each hip.
You’ve passed the standard when you can maintain sufficient, 120-degree hip flexion for 30
seconds, standing on one leg and then repeating with the other leg.
This isn’t just a test, of course, but an exercise in balance. If you’re going to count on your legs and
hips to generate copious amounts of stability as you run 3 miles, 10 miles, or more, it’s a good idea to
have the symphony of your motor control units, nervous pathways, and reflexes tuned. After you’ve
mastered 30 seconds, add a challenge by closing your eyes.
 
 
1. Standing on one leg with a braced neutral spine and your feet straight, pull one knee to
your chest to fully flex your hip.
2. Allow your hands to drop. To pass the standard, your knee must break the plane of the top
of your hip and achieve a 120-degree angle of flexion or better.
3. Why not work on your plantar flexion, too? Point your toes. Hold this position for 30
seconds, and then repeat with the other leg for 30 seconds.
 
FAULT. You want to hold a tall position of stability. Pitching all over
the sea doesn’t make for a successful test of this standard.
 
 
Runner to Runner
 
Like many of the standards, hip flexion is a component of healthy hip function. Running lots of miles
shorts most, if not all, of these components, and in the CrossFit classes I’ve attended, I’ve seen how
much damage my running career (combined with a profession in which I sit a lot) has done. As much
as I’ve improved in these areas, just about everyone else in the class has much better hip flexion and
extension than I have. As you work toward the hip flexion standard, I encourage you to be creative in
chasing down whatever might be impeding your range. For me, discovering that my psoas—the large
muscles that run from the lower lumbar spine through the groin and flex the hip—are so short and tight
from running and sitting that they’ve been the lock I never even thought of trying to turn.
 
As Kelly says, his mobility program is more of an open-source-code type of method. Take what he
presents, play around with the techniques, and do your own explorations. Test a standard like this one,
then perform a mobility exercise for two minutes, and then get up and retest. If you see a change, you
know you’re on to something.

BRIEFING
For many runners, the front of the hip, or anterior hip, is a huge patch of trouble. This standard may be
challenging for you to meet, depending on how much disarray your hips are in, but if you lay down
focused and consistent work toward meeting this standard, you will reap tremendous rewards. Your
hip function will improve, your posture will improve, and this may be the key to freeing you from the
standard knee problems.
 
Here’s a not-that-unique true story:
A 40-something runner with two decades of running, racing, and various wear-and-tear lines up for
a half-marathon.13 It’s a surprisingly hilly course on the streets near downtown Los Angeles. Thirteen
miles later, he tenderly crosses the finish line. As he hobbles his way through the post-race area
looking to pick up his pre-race belongings transported by semi-trailer, he notices pain sizzling
beneath both of his kneecaps. Sizzle is a good word, because he says that it felt like compressed
chemical fires smoldering.
The burning worsened. He looked for relief by sitting down on a curb and rubbing his knees. It
didn’t help. Eventually the pain subsided, but joint pain of that intensity is a stark reflection of soft
tissues and joints being exposed to destructive amounts of friction. This photo of the runner was taken
about a half-mile from the finish of the race. It wasn’t pretty. He right leg was reaching out, and his
heel was smashing into the ground, with a locked-out knee absorbing the punishment from a gruesome
heel strike. Was it any wonder that his knees felt like they were on fire?
I like car analogies, and this is one of my favorites: A runner who doesn’t take care of business
when it comes to poor movement patterns and the consequential shortening of the quadriceps and hip
flexors is doing the equivalent of playing gas-o-brake-o with a car. Keep one foot on the brake while
you jam the other down on the gas pedal, and then, when the RPMs are hot, let go of the brake,
sending the car lurching forward like a rocket. Then repeat. Do this long enough and you’ll set the
wheels on fire.
Knee pain is the most common chronic injury pain that runners confront, and a lot of the blame can
be assigned to the freakishly short and tight muscles responsible for extending the leg. It can reveal
itself in subtle ways.
A lot of the blame for knee pain can be assigned to the freakishly short and tight

At running shoe stores around the country, the gait test is a popular way to try to assess your
biomechanical tendencies in hopes of matching you up with the right shoe. You might hop on a
treadmill or head down the sidewalk for a series of short runs. The shoe salesman watching you often
sees a peculiar pattern. Sometimes it’s subtle, and sometimes it’s not so subtle.
What he sees is this: As you plant one foot on the ground, the other foot has swung forward to
become the new position of support. In the path of this movement—from leaving the ground behind to
re-establishing contact with the ground, your leg swings your foot forward. The kink that the running
shoe guy sees is in the way your foot rotates outward and your foot/leg operates in the manner of a
Ping-Pong paddle. Rather than a direct path—your foot and leg remaining in a straight, neutral
alignment throughout—this spinning-open movement looks as if you were trying to avoid slamming
your toe into a brick sticking up out of the pavement, and your foot is taking the long way around the
obstacle.
If you want to see how common this tic is, just spend some time in the pack of a big road race, and
you’ll see a virtual epidemic. What’s going on here?
This is what’s going on: If you are looping with your foot, you are missing one or more elements of
good, powerful hip function. The muscle tissues at the front of your hip, the hip flexor and quads, are
short, tight, and mashed up, which robs you of proper hip extension and the ability to maintain internal
rotation of your upper leg. This lack of internal rotation effectively spills open your pelvis, and you
end up dragging your leg around from foot plant to foot plant.
This spillage of stability and power has repercussions throughout your entire running system. It’s a
red carpet for the open-foot/knee-cave sequence that gives your joints an ugly twist of shear with
every footfall.
This surrender of good hip function stresses the tissues in your knees and ankles, which take an
ugly beating every time you go running. If you’re holding a cadence of 160 steps per minute, that’s
more than 1,200 steps, or duty cycles, taken per mile if you’re holding an 8-minutes-per-mile pace.
You can do some more math with that: If you run 50 miles per week, 50 weeks a year, and you
average 8 minutes per mile, we’re talking about more than 3 million lashes of the razor whip.
Shoes and orthotics are not going to fix this problem, and it should be considered a death knell for
your future as a healthy runner.
You must restore proper extension and internal rotation to your hips. You must restore it now and
again and again and again. If you sit a lot throughout the day, then working toward achieving and
maintaining this standard is going to require extra vigilance; you’re going to have to build in a new set
of habits.
I offer two primary weapons for you to use in the war on sitting:
 
Sit as little as possible. (See the sidebar “Why Sitting Really Is Hell on Square Wheels” here.)
Do the Couch Stretch every day. This stretch is to healthy running what flossing is to healthy
teeth.
THE COUCH STRETCH
The Couch Stretch is a weapons-grade technique to open up the hip and open up some slack upstream
of the knee. It can help alleviate some of the common types of knee pain that runners confront, like
patella tendinitis (aka runner’s knee), and help resolve hip and back pain. Meeting this standard will
support your mission to sustain good posture both in your running and as you go about your day.
 
 
 
 
Back your feet up against a wall, a box, or the upper
cushion of your couch. If you’re on a hard floor, put
down a cushion for your knee.
Slide your left leg so that your knee fits into the
corner where the floor meets the wall (or whatever
corner you’re using). Make your shin flush with the
wall and point your toe.
IMPORTANT: Squeeze your glutes, in particular your left glute. Keep squeezing throughout the
mobilization. This will stabilize your lower back and position your hip joint correctly.
 
Draw up your right leg and post it in front of you, with
your shin vertical.
TIP: If you’re too tight to get into the Couch Stretch position, scale it back by positioning a box in
front of you. Put your weight on the box and don’t worry about posting your leg, as in step 3. Work at
this daily for at least two minutes on each side to effect the tissue change that you need to improve
toward the unmodified position and meet this standard.
 
 
With your butt squeezed, drive the front of your hip
toward the ground. Maintain this position for at least
one minute.
 
Really crank your hip flexor by lifting your torso
(with your glutes still engaged) and hold for another
minute.
 
Drive your torso upright, with your glutes and
abdominals engaged.
 
why sitting really is hell on square wheels
 
To support good hip extension and overall hip function, don’t limit your work on this standard to four
minutes of mobility work per day. You need to overhaul the habits that do the damage.
 
If you’ve read a book like Born to Run or Running with the Kenyans, you have learned that
ethereal spirits like the Tarahumara Indians from northern Mexico and the runners from the Rift V
alley
in Kenya have a few things in common. For one thing, rather than jump into the VW to get to school or
drop off the dry cleaning, they run everywhere for transport. Getting dinner means either farming or
hunting on foot. Then, at night, the Tarahumaras like to throw a beer bash and drink and dance until
dawn, and then they go out and do some more running the next day.
Contrast this with a day in the life of the average American. The first stop is sitting at a breakfast
table over a bowl of Wheaties. The second stop is sitting in a car, bus, or train for the commute to
work or school. Work or school is usually a festival of more sitting, broken up with occasional
breaks. Then the commute home—more sitting—and then dinner, and then maybe it’s time to sink into
the couch for an episode or two of Survivor.
If there’s one critical takeaway from this book, it’s that every minute you spend sitting is a minute
spent with your hips turned off and positioned in a state of lazy flexion. Your hip flexors shorten as a
result, and all that tremendous power that you should be funneling into your running gets diminished to
a trickle.
I want you to adopt a warrior stance when it comes to the amount of time you spend sitting each
day. Cultivate an awareness that each minute you tick off sitting is doing damage to your body and to
your running. When you can, avoid sitting, or even open up a direct attack. Set your phone or watch
timer to go off every hour so that you get up out of your chair, mobilize for a minute or two, and then
(if you have to go back to sitting) sit down with your butt and stomach muscles turned on and engaged.
 
Runner to Runner
 
You know that quad stretch that you’ve probably done while waiting for a stoplight to turn green
during a run? One hand goes on the pole, the other hand grabs your foot and pulls the quad into a
stretch via a flexed leg. Okay, go ahead and do that, and then commit yourself to two minutes in the
Couch Stretch position.
 
I think the difference between what these two movements feel like and what they accomplish is
perhaps the best answer to the question “Why mobilize and not just stretch?” or the question “What’s
the difference between mobilizing and stretching?” The Couch Stretch, when performed correctly, is
not just horrifically uncomfortable for a tight-as-a-banjo runner; it’s a guide through the depths of
ball-and-socket anatomy. You become familiar with the deeper tissues around your hip joint as the
exercise helps you work toward proper position of the femur in the hip capsule. The quad-pull stretch
is easier to do, but it just doesn’t pack any punch. If I had to choose only one mobility exercise to do
from this book, it would probably be the Couch Stretch. It put an end to my knee troubles.

STANDARD #7: ANKLE RANGE OF MOTION
Q: Do you have normal range of motion in your ankles?
 
To achieve this standard, you need to be able to express a normal range of ankle motion with a dose
of bodyweight load—in other words, be able to kneel and hold the pistol position with either leg.
 
KEY MOTIV
ATION
Unglued ankles enable you to move with optimal patterns and access the full, free power of elastic
recoil for your running.
 
recommended mobility exercises for ankle range of motion
 
Your feet and ankles are amazing spring-like mechanisms that offer tremendous quantities of elastic
recoil. To open them up, work on these mobilizations:
 
 
Plantar Mobilizations (see here)
Dorsiflexion Work (see here)
Plantar Flexion Overdrive (see here)
Anterior Hip Smash (see here)
Couch Stretch (see here)
 
BRIEFING
Meeting this standard is going to seem like an insurmountable challenge to many runners. Because
runners’ lower legs take considerable abuse, most runners who drop into a yoga class for the first
time struggle just to point their toes; the image of the foot being pressed by body weight into a
position of full plantar flexion sends up a pain chill. Chalk this up to being a fact of the running life.
But a lack of range of motion in your ankle joints won’t just earn you frowns in yoga class. In a
runner, it is expressed in the turned-out duck-foot position (see Chapter 4), valgus knee collapse,
collapsed arches, plantar fascia stress, bone spurs, bunions, and—it almost goes without saying—
injury pain that threatens to turn the runner into a former runner.
 
Because it is the center of such strife for runners, I’m going to talk specifically about the heel cord,
but first I’d like to frame the ankle joint and the surrounding fascias (connective tissues), bones, and
muscles as a system. Within this system lies the connection between the leaf spring–like mechanism of
your feet and arches to your lower leg bones.
The Achilles tendon, or what we often call the heel cord, is a 6-inch stretch of tendon that attaches
the calf muscles to the heel bone. It’s so tough that you could use it to suspend a Ford Fiesta above the
ground.
The Achilles tendon is so tough that you could use it to suspend a Ford Fiesta.
 
Yet, as another testament to the way distance runners can put on the blinders and dutifully fill up the
logbook from the awakening of spring to the darkest depths of winter, the degeneration into a state of
chronic tendonosis is not uncommon. Despite the amazing capacity of the heel cord, running lots of
miles and running fast tend to stiffen it up—even more so if you’ve been running in shoes with steep
drops and with your knees caving inward, rolling through collapsed arches, and pulling your heel
cords off the vertical axis.
Add to your running mileage the following punishers:
 
The 10,000 or so steps that you take in a day
Any stress that you might channel through the conduits in the weight room
The price that’s been exacted if you’ve spent considerable time in shoes with elevated
heels
Y

eight hours a day
This chain of problems can be expressed in debilitating knee pain.
You know the saying that there are no bad dogs, only bad dog owners? The same has been said
about runners and other athletes in regard to tissues like the heel cord. There are no bad heel cords,
only bad heel cord owners. When the ankle and heel cord are treated poorly, the repercussions can
and will be felt up and down the kinetic chain.
There are no bad heel cords, only bad heel cord owners.
 
In consistently working toward and maintaining this standard, I want you to embrace becoming the
good-dog-owner type.
By encouraging you to pursue the ankle range of motion standard, I am primarily coaxing you to
strive for and maintain a healthy, functional, and elastic ankle complex. If you’re a runner with some
solid numbers on the odometer and you haven’t been performing regular maintenance on your feet and
ankles, then meeting this standard is going to take some work and some patience.
 
So let’s start at the beginning. I imagine that if you’re reading this book, you want to
 
Become a better runner.
Make running a regular part of your training program.
Run better in the service of your sport or profession.
Make a return to running from the chaos of injury.
Ensure as best you can that you will enjoy running for the rest of your life.
You’re the reason I put this book together. And making a daily habit of working toward normal
range of motion in your ankles and feet is going to help you achieve these goals.
 
In the running world, it is widely accepted that stiff, immobile ankles are one of costs of doing
business. But the real cost is performance. If you are limited in either plantar flexion (pointing your
toe) or dorsiflexion (flexing your foot), then you are leaving a big pile of gold coins on the table in
terms of the capacity to use the movement patterns you were born to use and the elastic recoil that
translates to power and speed over lengthy spans of road and trail.
The value of elastic recoil for a runner made for one of my favorite scenes in the movie Gallipoli,
when the young Aussie sprinter, Archy, gets coached by his uncle.
Uncle: What are your legs?
Archy: Springs. Steel springs.
What are they going to do?
Hurl me down the track.
How fast can you run?
As fast as a leopard.
How fast are you going to run?
As fast as a leopard!
Then let’s see you do it!
 
That’s right: as fast as a leopard. But if the springs have been transmogrified into tourniquets and
have become part of the stability-shoe-as-a-plaster-cast system, then this isn’t going to happen. Poor
ankle range of motion is also a side effect of wearing shoes that elevate your heels (as discussed in
Chapter 5).
Here’s the good news: Your tissues can change, your joints can change, and you can change.
Your tissues can change, your joints can change, and you can change.
 
But it’s not going to happen overnight. Making the appropriate changes to your tissues and joints
takes consistent, steady attention over days, weeks, and months. There is no magic pill, and a
weekend workshop alone is at best going to put you on the right path.
Pursuing the ankle range of motion standard means committing to a journey similar to that of
transforming your physiology to be aerobically prepared to run a marathon. It’s going to take the same
brand of work ethic and patience.
The path is committing at least 15 minutes per day to the work of repositioning your joints,
restoring the glide between the sliding surfaces in your tissues, and improving your movement
patterns.
Obsessed with performance? Then daily routine maintenance on your feet and ankles needs to
become an obsession as well.
To meet this standard, you’ll need to pass the following two tests. Both tests insert a dose of load
so that you get true insight into the functionality of your ankles. Double win: Passing these tests also
requires healthy hip function.
TEST #1: DORSIFLEXION
Can you get into the pistol position? The pistol is a full-flexion single-leg squat.
 
Start in a standing position with your feet together.
Drive your knees outward as you lower your butt toward the
ground.
Rounding your back is okay, but keep your heels on the ground. The
focus is on ankle flexion.
 
With your butt lowered, prepare to extend your right leg
into the pistol position.
This is the complete pistol position. Notice how the left leg
is in full flexion, the heel is on the ground, and the knee is
tracking in line with the foot.
COLLAPSED-FOOT FAULT. When the arch collapses, the knee
goes with it.
TEST #2: PLANTAR FLEXION
Can you get into a kneeling position?
 
 
 
1. This is it: a full kneeling position with both feet in dorsiflexion. As fascia expert Jill Miller
will tell you, spending time in this position will do wonders for the battered and shortened
fascia within your feet and around your ankles. Don’t be surprised if you start sweating
even though you’re still.

Ready to Run is meant to be a bridge for a runner besieged with injury problems and power outages
to a state in which the body can run the way it was designed to run. Part of getting to the end state is
addressing running form. You’ve probably heard of some of the programs available, the Pose Method
being the one that started it all. By working toward and ideally meeting the 12 Ready to Run
standards, you will put your body in a good position to take on this exceptionally valuable, yet often
complicated transformation.
 
One of the potholes for a lot of runners converting from a heel strike to a forefoot strike is the
different form of stress on the ankle complex. I experienced it myself the first time I tried Pose
Running drills while migrating toward a CrossFit Endurance approach to running. My heel cords had
been short for some time. The Pose drills call on the feet and lower legs to behave like thick-coiled
springs, and elasticity of these springs becomes a primary currency of running. But if you lack range
of motion in your ankles and your heel cords are weakened from the kind of atrophy that comes with
heel-striking, it can be too much. After four weeks of drills, I was enjoying major progress—I had
adapted to a faster cadence and the trip hammer–like action that the running form uses. So I started
doing more and more of it. That put too much stress on my left ankle, and I ended up with a hotspot
that took several weeks to cool down.
My suggestion is to prepare. If you’re going to make the commitment to change your running form,
really have this standard and the Jumping and Landing standard dialed in. As Dr. Nicholas Romanov,
the scientist who defined the Pose Method, told me in an interview, “You have to have complete
commitment.” So it’s probably best to start your running drills very slowly—drilling once or twice a
week max—and allow your body to progressively adapt to the new stress. As Kelly says, tissues
have the capacity to change, but it takes time. Let your heel cords strengthen with the work.
If you attend a weekend workshop to learn a new running technique, go in with patience. It’s the
rare runner indeed who is going to be able to turn his or her running technique inside out in two days
and never look back. Brian MacKenzie’s CrossFit Endurance website has a guide to preparing for a
weekend seminar: www.crossfitendurance.com/seminarprep. (MacKenzie teaches the Pose Method at
his CFE seminars.) It may take you up to a year to fully ingrain the new movement patterns. Starting
with good hip function, adequate range of motion throughout your body, and strong, supple ankles will
make a huge difference.

CHAPTER 11
STANDARD #8: WARMING UP AND COOLING DOWN
Q: Do you routinely perform pre-run warm-ups and post-run cool-downs?
 
Even if your schedule is already crushed, you need to make warming up and cooling down a priority
for every run and figure out a way to do it every time.
 
KEY MOTIV
ATION
Athletes who run often give short shrift to warm-ups and cool-downs. Or they discard them
completely. But by making a concentrated effort to perform a solid warm-up and cool-down before
and after each and every workout that includes running, you’ll gain tremendous injury prevention and
accelerated recovery benefits.
 
recommended mobility exercises for warm-ups and cool-downs
 
Air squats (see here) and jumping rope are potent exercises to help you warm up your joints and
tissues. Use your cool-down time to work on your mobility weaknesses—or you can always hit the
reset button with these favorites:
 
 
Couch Stretch (see here)
Hip Capsule Rotation (see here)
Spending time in a deep squat
 
BRIEFING
We are all mad for performance. It’s in this madness that the passion and fun of being an athlete lives.
In rating yourself on this standard, take a good look at how much of this passion and willingness to
push yourself in a workout—be it a tempo run, a grueling MetCon, or a soccer scrimmage—you are
funneling toward a thorough warm-up and a thorough cool-down.
 
I’ve traveled to nearly every continent teaching courses in human performance and mechanics in
every imaginable athletic setting, from universities to CrossFit gyms to professional and national team
facilities to military performance centers. Most of these gyms are stocked with a plenitude of foam
rollers. And before a group workout starts, I’ll see a few of the athletes lying around on the floor,
haphazardly using the rollers, in stark contrast to the several others who are going just as hard at their
warm-ups as they will in the workout. They jump rope, perform mobility work to prepare their joints
and various muscle groups for the workout of the day, and work on their weak spots.
You see the same duality at a triathlon team track workout. Some athletes stand on the infield,
chatting with friends, hanging out, and waiting for the start time. Others are actively performing
running drills, mobilizing, and performing full-body functional movements like lunges and burpees to
get their tissues hot and their circulatory systems moving.
Training is also about how you prepare for a workout and how you close it out.
 
Training is not about the workout alone. It’s also about how you prepare for the workout and how
you close it out. You train to make your body stronger, faster, more durable, and better able to sustain
long efforts. You train to incur these sorts of physical adaptations within your body. To meet this
standard, you need to think beyond the 6 x 800s on the track, or how fast you can perform five rounds
of a 400-meter run and 15 overhead squats (the CrossFit workout known as Nancy). It’s about
thinking of yourself as an athlete around the clock:
 
How well are you hydrating throughout the day?
Are you getting enough sleep?
Are you sitting as little as possible, and when you do sit, are you working in short spurts of
mobility work to counter the effects?
And it’s about making time to do an appropriate warm-up before every workout and a thorough
cool-down after every workout. If you put your energy into a hard training effort but do little
beforehand and nothing afterward to maximize the benefits of that training, or to do it in a way that
doesn’t shred your tissues, then you aren’t netting a full return on your hard-fought investment. You
won’t achieve the full amount of adaptation that you could, and the injury risk factor gets ratcheted up
as well.
Does the driver of a Formula 1 race car just buckle up and smash the pedal to the floor? Does the
winning jockey in the Kentucky Derby cross the finish line with his horse and then hop right out of the
saddle? Of course not. With the Ferrari F14 T, the driver uses an external heater to warm up the
engine before he even thinks of hitting the ignition. Cooling down a horse? This is what Trainer
Magazine has to say:
“The aim of a cool-down period is a progressive reduction in exercise intensity allowing a
gradual redistribution of blood flow, enhanced lactic acid removal from the muscles, and a
reduction of body heat through convection and evaporation. If a horse is inadequately
cooled after competing, any residual lactate in the system will affect performance if the
horse is required to compete again within a short space of time. The application of cold
water will result in heat loss by conduction from the skin to the water, thus reducing body
temperature. The active cool-down will also result in an effective return to normal
breathing and heart rate.”14
 
Contrast these images with a lunch-hour run. It’s a time-challenged situation—you have to blast
your way from work to a place to change into your training clothes and then to wherever you’re going
to run, do your workout, and then rush to be back on the job. In this situation, a prioritization process
takes place, and the warm-up and cool-down often get tossed. They are taken for granted as
unaffordable luxuries.
This gets to the problem that modern athletes living in the post-agricultural/post-industrial
information age face. Except for an hour or so when we have time to train, most of us live in a
sedentary fashion—a lifestyle we aren’t designed for. From the viewpoint of evolution and biology,
our bodies were engineered for long periods of walking and lots of moving around to survive. But in
modern civilization—except for that run or trip to the gym—we’re physically lethargic. When we
work, when we’re in the car or on the bus, and when we’re having dinner, we are sedentary.
Here’s a scenario that’s probably going to sound familiar: You have a morning run workout
scheduled, and you wake up, drink some coffee, and go at it, figuring that you’ll warm up as you get
going into the session. The problem is that you’re trying to warm up by hammering the pavement with
cold joints, connective tissues, and muscles, and with no “oil” running through your system. It might
seem like you’re getting away with something, but consider this: If it is 5:00 a.m. and your beloved
Ferrari has been sitting outside in the cold all night, are you just going to turn on the ignition and hit
the gas and hope that the drive to the freeway on-ramp is enough to warm it up without any strain?
The worst thing you can do after you finish a workout is to sit your butt down in a chair for a long
time. You’ve put in a big dose of stimulation, and then you pull up to your desk. Sitting brings muscle
contractions to a halt, and muscle contractions are what help clear congestion out of your system.
Sitting shuts down the recovery mechanisms that are critical to your training adaptations. Your
circulation is compromised, and so is your lymphatic system. It’s like tying knots in a bunch of garden
hoses.
Here’s my message: Your muscles, fascias, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and nerves deserve the
same amount of obsession as a race car or racehorse, if not way more.
You’re already strapped for time. So what can you do? If you commit yourself to ritualizing warm-
ups and cool-downs, you’re halfway there.
Your muscles, fascias, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and nerves deserve the same
amount of obsession as a race car or racehorse, if not way more.
 
W
ARMING UP
Every time you work out, start with a few minutes of walking to get your blood flowing. Follow that
with some dynamic, nonlinear, full-body movements, like arm circles, lunges, and burpees. Take two
minutes to mobilize any high-priority joints or range of motion issues with a mobility exercise or two
from Part 3 of this book. One last useful measure is to do some quick jump-rope work. Jumping rope
is great for:
 
 
Strengthening your feet
Waking up your foot strike
Jump-starting your heart and getting the fluids moving within your body
Heating up the precious soft tissues within your feet and around your ankles that extend
into your calves
COOLING DOWN
Don’t finish your workout at warp 8 and then transition like a triathlete through a shower into your
business suit and sink into an executive recliner for the rest of the day. Instead, here’s a power move
you can do: Turn the last half-mile of your run into a walk. Imagine that you own Seabiscuit, and
you’re protecting your cherished investment. While you walk, do some leg swings, arm swings, trunk
rotations, and the like to maximize the benefits.
 
If that’s all the cooling down you have time for, that’s all you have time for, and that alone is
fantastic. If you can add five minutes of mobility work with a lacrosse ball, roller, or other
mobilization tool in order to get in some work on one of the other standards, that’s even better.
Then spend as much of the rest of the day as you can drinking fluids and being an athlete rather than
sitting. Beware the chair. If you do have to sit, get up and reset yourself with the bracing sequence
(see here) as often as possible. Throw in the occasional mobility minute when you can.
Here are some good cool-downs. I recommend 10 to 15 minutes for these, but if five minutes is
what you have, then five minutes it is:
 
An easy 10 to 15 minutes on a rowing machine
An easy bike ride around the neighborhood
A walk—barefoot if possible
A selection of bodyweight movements, like lunges, jumping jacks, and arm and leg circles
THE ACCORDION
I’ve got one last note for you on warming up and cooling down. You probably already understand this
one, but it’s worth underscoring: The amount of warming up and cooling down you do needs to
increase when your workout involves greater intensity.
 
The amount of warming up and cooling down you do needs to increase when your
workout involves greater intensity.
 
Let’s say that your training session consists of 6 x 800 meters on the track at your 5k race pace. It’s
a tough workout, both physically and psychologically. Fully preparing your systems for the jolt of the
first rep might require 30 to 45 minutes. If you’re a Masters runner and/or you have an injury rap
sheet that you’d rather not think about, definitely aim for the higher number of warm-up minutes.
Warm up like a sprinter. Sprinters may race for only 10 or 20 seconds, but their warm-ups and cool-
downs are long and involved processes. A good sprinter knows full well that he or she isn’t going to
be at full speed without a hard, no-stone-unturned warm-up and a coolant-flush warm-down.
This inverse relationship between the time you spend warming up and the duration of a race or
other competition is a key principle to embrace: The shorter the event, the more speed and power
required, the more warm-up. A CrossFit athlete waiting for the clock to start on high-octane workout
like Fran would be wise to spend a lot more time warming up than a CrossFit athlete about to start
Murph.15 Similarly, the amount of warm-up you’re going to require before a flat road marathon is
very different from the amount you might need before a 3-mile cross-country race on a roller-coaster
course.
For hard, high-intensity training, it’s best to make sure that you have more than 5 minutes for your
warm-up and more than 5 minutes for your cool-down. It would be much better to have 20 minutes on
either side of any hard anaerobic effort.

15 Fran consists of 21-15-9 reps of thrusters and pull-ups. The world’s best CrossFitters finish it in 2 to 3 minutes.
Murph is a 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats, and another 1-mile run, all while wearing a 20-pound weight
vest, and it takes most athletes at least an hour to perform.
CHAPTER 12
STANDARD #9: COMPRESSION
Q: Are you wearing compression socks?
 
For more than half a century, doctors have been prescribing compression for patients who need a
boost in their blood circulation. The first compression socks may have been designed for people
battling varicose veins, but this doesn’t mean that they won’t benefit you as an athlete.
 
KEY MOTIV
ATION
Compression is a relatively easy and effective way to assist your body’s circulation and lymphatic
systems in restoring worked tissue.
 
BRIEFING
There isn’t much detail to this standard. It boils down to this: You’re an athlete. And the starting wide
receiver for the Green Bay Packers is an athlete. He has access to a world-class training staff and
every technology on the market to help him recover from training, practice, and the trauma of the many
game-day collisions that are part of his life. You don’t have the same access to a training room staff,
but you still take a pounding from your running (in no way similar to life in the NFL, but hey, it’s still
a pounding). One thing you can afford? Compression socks. Wearing compression socks doesn’t
require a lot of time, and it really doesn’t cost that much money. And it works. You’re buried in
commitments, and you may not have the time or money for a weekly massage, but compression socks
will do you good. Buy a pair and wear them as often and as consistently as possible.
 
Compression socks will do you good. Buy a pair and wear them as often and as
consistently as possible.
 
Imagine this scenario: After nine months of training for the NYC Marathon, you board a 757 for a
flight from Phoenix to JFK Airport and shoehorn yourself into the window seat. You bunch up a jacket
and cram it against the hull to serve as a pillow, trying to sleep. When make your first move to
deplane, you feel as if you’re being extracted from a crashed car. It takes the better part of the next
few hours to feel your legs again.
The race begins the next morning on the V
errazano Bridge. With 48,000 other runners, you tour 26.2
miles of the five boroughs and cross the finish line in Central Park. The celebration begins.
Eventually, a margarita appears in your hand.
The next day, you fold yourself into another window seat on another plane, the vessel climbs to
cruising altitude, and you head for home. Your legs are throbbing from the 26.2-mile effort. But the
race is over now, so what?
As I’m sure you picked up on, if you were this runner, you put your body through the ringer. Most
athletes know that flying accelerates dehydration, and that carrying a water bottle (better to spike that
water with salts— see here) and getting up whenever possible during the flight to assist your body’s
blood and lymph systems keeps things moving into, out of, and around your cells.
What I see in otherwise highly disciplined athletes when they travel for a big event is a failure to
think about the needs of their tissues and their internal chemistry. Answering those needs will make
for not only a better tomorrow, but a better future in general. After a race has blown your tissues to
hell, it is more important than ever to eat nutritious meals; rehydrate; spend time moving, massaging,
and rolling your tissues; and get good rest to let your systems do their repair work.
Failure to maintain this kind of discipline can be seen during the average week in some athletes.
For example, the worst thing you can do after tearing through your morning run is to race off to work
and sit all day. (You’ll notice that this point comes up throughout this book.) Why? Because sitting
shuts down the lymph system and brings your body’s cellular cleaning and repair systems to a cold
stop.
I get it, though: You have only so much time. Squeezing in a one-hour run is not easy. This standard
is meant as a time-efficient helper for time-stressed runners, and it’s a simple one to implement.
Use compression socks. Strategize a solution for wearing them at least some of the time every day.
While there is debate about whether compression wear is of any value while running, there’s no
valid argument against wearing a simple pair of compression socks after your daily workout or when
you fly—two of the most critical times when compression will help you.
You can buy a pair of compression socks at your local running shoe store or online for about $25.
They’re worth it. They’re easy to use—just pull them on after a run or before you board a plane. Sure,
you can opt for the full leggings or more, but all I’m asking for with this standard is that you make a
habit of wearing compression socks. You can wear them under your business-casual clothes and
generally avoid the dork factor that comes with compression wear. (If you wear your compression
socks with Birkenstocks, you’re on your own.)
Hopping on a transcontinental flight after a marathon? Wear as much compression apparel as you
can get your hands on.
Compression is such a vital weapon in your arsenal, in fact, that it plays a major component in the
next standard: stamping out tissue hotspots.
 
Runner to Runner
It’s almost weird that a technology like compression for recovery is as controversial as it is. When it
comes to supporting the notion that compression wear, worn while at rest, can improve blood flow
and thus prod the recovery cycle of training, the research is solid.16 Following the information that
came through from the Byrne study, a runner would be prudent to shop for socks with compression of
around 20 mmHg for optimal blood flow (mmHg, or millimeters of mercury, is a unit of pressure).
 
Although compression wear gets slammed by some critics, there’s no doubt that runners, triathletes,
and CrossFitters are using it in great numbers. It can’t be considered a study by any measure, but each
year that I flew across the Pacific to cover the Hawaii Ironman, I noticed an increasing percentage of
the triathletes on board wearing compression socks. (It’s always easy to spot the triathletes—
sunglasses, race T-shirts, Ironman tattoos, carry-on luggage in the shape of race wheels, men with
shaved legs.) Triathletes have long been early adopters of new technologies—like aerodynamic
handlebars—even if they look funny.
There’s an additional occasion on which I’ve started wearing compression socks: immediately
after any sort of high-intensity workout that involves running. I’ve always been prone to calf cramps
after interval running and long race efforts—calf cramps that feel like someone has plunged a
switchblade into my gastrocs. Any measure to prevent that feeling, be it nutrition, mobility work, or
recovery techniques, I’m all for using.

CHAPTER 13
STANDARD #10: NO HOTSPOTS
Q: Are you free of hotspots of pain?
 
You are Ready to Run when your routine maintenance is up-to-date and you have no hot, sketchy
tissues or joints.
 
 
KEY MOTIV
ATION
Staying a runner is the key motivation here—not having to trade in your morning run for reading the
newspaper on the Lifecycle. Running through pain and injury has repercussions. There’s no getting
away with it: It is how you do more damage or wear things out for good. The benefit of fixing your
hotspots is that you get to enjoy being a runner now and for years to come.
 
BRIEFING
Imagine that you’re three months into a six-month training plan for a marathon in which you want to
PR (set a personal record). You’ve been going at it hard, mixing in long runs, fast runs, and a few
races: some local 5ks and 10ks to blow out the tubes.
 
It’s been great. Your race times are improving, and your pace for your long runs is dropping. But
you can’t help but notice that a few annoying little pains are starting to crop up. Your left heel burns
during the first mile of a run. And there’s a throbbing pain from deep in your right hip that haunts you
after you finish a run.
A couple of weeks go by, and the pains seem to be sharpening rather than going away. They’re
getting worse. You’re beginning to wonder if it’s time to shift into cross-training mode or to go
through the boring suffer-fest that is wearing a flotation belt and water-jogging in a pool.
You’re in a running club, and in that club is an ultrarunning star. When some people think of
ultramarathoning, they think of 50-mile runs, 100-kilometer trail races, or a 135-mile scorcher across
Death V
alley. The ultrarunner in your club does that, but even more: Once a year he jumps into a six-
day race. The gun goes off, and whoever accumulates the most miles in six days wins. The guy on
your team wins one of these things every year. So you figure—reasonably—that he must know
something about defying injuries. Anyone who can run 160 miles a week in training and then run more
than 110 miles a day for six days to win a race must have some otherworldly insight into how to
evade injuries. So in a running shoe store where you happen to bump into him, you ask:
“What’s your advice on dealing with injuries?”
The ultrarunner looks you in the eye the way a Jedi Master would, and then he gives you the
answer:
“I’m not the right guy to talk to about that.”
He goes on to explain that his mastery over injury has a lot to do with his ability to ignore injury
pain. In other words, he just runs through it.
Sound familiar? As you dial in this standard, the first thing to acknowledge is how the average
runner can tolerate discomfort. It is indeed a Jedi power: You’re at mile 23 of a marathon, with 3
miles to go, and you’re in extremis (Latin for “at the point of death”). Not only do you keep going, but
you keep holding your goal race pace for 3.2 anguish-filled and never-ending miles. You have gone
metaphysical.
But there’s a dark side to this power: Runners and other athletes tend to wield it like a sword
against the discomfort they encounter in races and in hard workouts, and it builds up a stubborn inner
strength that unfortunately leads to ignoring the signal flares being sent from the depths of the body
that damage is being done.
You have heel pain? Or your knee is dodgy? Or there’s a stabbing pain in your butt? There’s a
mechanics problem or a dysfunction of some sort that is screaming to be taken care of.
Can you run through it? Temporarily, yes. Your body is amazing when it comes to meeting the
demands that you place on it. To draw from another sci-fi domain, you are Captain Kirk, and your
body is like Mr. Scott and the Starship Enterprise. Even if you’ve taken heavy damage from battle, if
you tell Mr. Scott to find you more power and get you to hold warp 10, Mr. Scott will jerry-rig some
energy pathway, even if it brings the rattling ship to the brink of exploding.
The body tends to have a failsafe mechanism, however, when you keep pushing and grinding your
way past injuries. It will shut down. In the case of the six-day champion ultrarunner, this is exactly
what happened. Struck by a bad case of piriformis sciatica (deep butt pain that can be felt down the
leg), he put his head down and tried to run through it. His body shut down on him, and his running
came to a prolonged stop.
When you keep pushing and grinding your way past injuries, your body will shut down.
 
The culture of running through pain and its badge-of-honor quality are interwoven into all sports
that are categorized by the word endurance. When the athletic test revolves around how much can be
endured, lines get crossed. Running through hotspots over months and years can lead to devastating
consequences. Some of the more severe examples include peroneal tendon surgery in the ankle, the
surgical removal of shredded knee cartilage, and hip replacement.
It’s not just the badge-of-honor culture. It’s that a runner doesn’t want to give up the daily run. It’s
crazy how much damage a state of denial can throw down upon a joint that was meant to last 110
years. Consider this forum post from “Amanda D” on www.hiprunner.com, a website for runners who
have had hip replacements:
“I’ve been lying to myself and others about the pain for several months now. I believe my
mental need to run has outweighed the physical pain of running for me for awhile. But I did
finally go to an orthopedic surgeon (well, 3) last week, and all were shocked by my bone
on bone osteoarthritis in my left hip and how I was walking (barely) let alone running.”
 
As I said at the beginning of this book: I’m on your side. I want you to be able to run until your last
days on Earth. But that’s not going to happen if you fail to understand a fundamental rule when it
comes to movement:
If you feel pain during or after moving, then what you were doing was not
functional movement.
 
So while running is considered a compound, functional movement that we humans were designed to
do in daily life, if you’re feeling pain or limping with a hotspot, then you’re doing something wrong.
As I like to say, if it feels sketchy, it is sketchy. If you have a gnawing sensation that you may be
grinding up some soft tissue, guess what? You’re probably grinding up some soft tissue. If you feel
something burning, tearing, or becoming inflamed, it’s time to take a few steps back and fix the
problem.
The purpose of this standard is to get you to tune in and respond immediately to all of your body’s
signals. If your process has been to wait around until the pain or swelling becomes so bad that you
think, Oh no! I have to do something about this!, then you’ve waited too long. It’s like being a
soldier in a firefight who waits for his M16 to jam before he realizes that he probably should have
cleaned it recently.
FIXING HOTSPOTS
First of all, let’s revisit running shoes and clear something out of the mindset. I talked about this
earlier in the book, but it’s worth mentioning again because it’s so pervasive and automatic. For
years, this has been an all-too-common program for dealing with running injuries:
 
 
1. A runner goes running.
2. The runner notices a tweak during the run. ________ starts hurting, and the hot, wincing
pain gets worse as the run goes on.
3. The runner still feels pain after the run. He gets out a bag of frozen peas, puts it on the
hotspot, and tries to “stretch it out.”
4. The runner thinks, “I must need a different type of running shoe.”
Here’s a new model:
 
1. The runner does a thorough warm-up before the run (see here), including mobility work to
tend to areas in particular need (see Part 3).
2. The runner notices a tweak during the run. ________ starts hurting, and the runner
immediately cuts the run short.
3. Back at home, the runner begins focused compression work on and near the hotspot. (See
“VooDoo Floss Band compression to the rescue,” coming up next.)
4. The runner performs mobilizations above and below the problem. This is as simple as it
sounds—go after the tissue above and below the hotspot with the mobility exercises
outlined in Part 3 of this book. Spend at least two minutes with each mobilization. If the
hotspot is in your knee, for example, then you should perform mobilizations for your lower
leg and upper thigh.
VooDoo Floss Band compression to the rescue
Compression is not just a tool for managing your ongoing recovery. When you tweak something and a
joint swells up, compression is a dynamic aid that, if used correctly, will work wonders to restore
range of motion and heal sticky sliding surfaces between tissues.
 
Let’s say, for example, that your heel is sore and inflamed. At the heart of the Ready to Run
approach is that I want you to dig into the underlying mechanics and repair the problem at its root.
This may include some of the following measures:
 
Restoring foot and arch strength
Adapting to a flat shoe
Improving your posture
Improving the channel of force moving from your posterior chain
But that heel is also going to need some immediate attention. I want you to apply deep compression
immediately above and below the hotspot.
I call this compression technique “V
ooDoo” because it attacks a swollen joint or dinged muscle in
a broad spectrum of ways. You may not be sure why it worked, but you’ll know that it worked.
Here are some of the ways V
ooDoo Floss Band compression can help you:
 
It restores sliding surface function, creating an omnipotent shearing effect that unglues
those sticky sliding surfaces.
It restores range of motion to the joint.
It floods the area with blood. When you release the band, blood floods in with nutrients.
This is especially valuable for those connective tissues that don’t easily get a lot of blood
flow.
It reduces swelling and revives the joint. When a joint is swollen, the natural stream of
information from proprioceptors is lost, as nerve endings get dulled. Joint mechanics suffer.
VooDoo Floss Band compression pushes swelling back into the lymphatic system.
 
VooDoo Floss Band compression technique
 
Be forewarned that V
ooDoo Floss Band compression isn’t as enjoyable as a Swedish massage; it’s on
the uncomfortable side of things. But use common sense: If it hurts in a sketchy way, then it’s sketchy.
 
Here’s the essential method for using V
ooDoo Floss Band compression to manage a fresh hotspot:
 
1. Start a few inches below the hotspot.
2. Wrap the band toward your heart. If you’re wrapping your knee, for example, start below
the knee.
3. Use a half-inch overlap with each wrap of the band.
4. Shoot for about 75 percent of stretch tension when wrapping the problem spot. The areas
above and below it can be at about 50 percent tension.
5. Leave a bit of slack as you near the finish so that you can tie off the band.
6. Once it’s wrapped, immediately begin moving the joint or the entire limb through its full
range of motion.
7. If you start to go numb in the area of the band, or if you feel pins and needles coming on,
it’s time to unwrap. This can happen in just two minutes.
8. After unwrapping, don’t be alarmed if the hue of your skin makes you think of a cadaver.
Normal flesh tone will return with the rush of fresh blood.
If you are using V
ooDoo Floss Band compression to restore sliding surfaces, two or three times per
day is going to be plenty.
If you are using compression to counter swelling, then five to ten times per day is okay.
 
VooDoo Floss Band compression sample 1: tweaky knee
This sequence is an example of how you would use V
ooDoo Floss Band compression if you were
experiencing the all-too-common runner’s knee type of inflammation, with pain below your kneecap.
Start below your knee and wrap toward your heart, using a half-inch overlap and 75 percent stretch
tension, as mentioned above. Tie off the wrap near the top and then floss the tissues by alternatively
pointing and flexing your foot for two minutes.
 
 
 
VooDoo Floss Band compression sample 2: iliotibial band pain
Here’s an example of how you would use V
ooDoo Floss Band compression for an annoying pain on
the outside of your knee or above your kneecap. After wrapping, start flossing the joint, hamstrings,
and quads by executing squats. Use a support if it helps you get into a good, deep position.
 
 
VooDoo Floss Band compression sample 3: hamstring pain
For one of those nasty, chronic hamstring tears, wrap center-mass over the hotspot—the middle of the
hamstring.
 
 
VooDoo Floss Band compression sample 4: Achilles tendon area
After you wrap your ankle as shown in the photos, floss the tissues of the ankle by flexing and
extending your foot. You’ll feel the band riffle through those sliding surface tissues.
 
CHAPTER 14
STANDARD #11: HYDRATION
Q: Are you hydrated?
 
Every day, you need to aggressively attend to your body’s hydration level. Achieving this standard
means that you’re drinking at least 2 to 3 liters per day. When you’re not drinking your water with
food, it should be spiked with electrolytes to facilitate absorption.
 
KEY MOTIV
ATION
A hard-training athlete wants to hydrate for several reasons. Failing this standard could cost you as
much as 11 percent of your max VO2—the indicator of how much oxygen your body can process for
the sustained output of running power—as well as properly functioning joints and sliding surfaces
between the layers of tissue that are getting scorched in your hard workouts. That’s just the beginning.
However, let’s underscore those two items. By simply drinking enough of the right fluids:
 
 
Y
ou will not be leaving on the table top-end endurance, and
Y
our all-important running muscles and connective tissues will be not be parched like tinder
for a campfire.
BRIEFING
As a runner, you can’t afford the costs of being dehydrated. When your total body water volume is
running low, there’s less blood available for circulation. When there’s less blood available for
circulation, your body’s delivery of oxygen and nutrients to your tissues is compromised. Less oxygen
to your working muscles means less performance.
 
When it comes to your body and your performance, water is a smart bomb. It dissolves.
It circulates. It removes.
 
Water is key to your body’s thermoregulation system. The average human loses nearly 3 liters of
water a day to breathing, perspiration, and peeing. About 3 cups of that water is lost through—no
kidding—the bottoms of the feet. Add running to the equation, and those numbers go up.
Let’s talk about your tissues. You were born with these super-amazing tissues that work together to
propel you over long distances in your running. There’s a lot you can do to take care of them, mend
them, and enhance them, and it all starts with hydration. It’s not just the water in the individual cells
that provides the aqueous environment for your mitochondria to produce energy; it’s also the
interstitial fluid between cells and all the various balances and counterbalances of electrolytes.
I talk a lot about the value of maintaining good sliding surfaces, particularly around your joints.
Specifically, I’m talking about how the various tissues—skin, nerves, muscles, and connective tissues
—operate. Do your nerves slide through your muscles? Does your skin slide over your bones? How
do interrelated tissues slide and glide with one another? Dehydration is one of the factors that can
glue these things together, limiting your range of motion in a key area like your ankle.
Let’s talk about your joints and the cartilage between your joints. When cartilage is properly
hydrated, the joints glide. Dehydrated cartilage? The joints tend to grind. If you want to rid yourself of
rheumatoid pain, you know what’s a good place to start? Drinking water and moving around.
Hydration for an endurance athlete isn’t just about diminishing the effects of a hot day. It has
everything to do with how you train and how you digest that training.
 
That’s right: When it comes to your body and your performance, water is a smart bomb. It
dissolves. It circulates. It removes. It’s the solvent in your body, just as water is the solvent in
seawater. Enzymatic reactions take place in your body’s aqueous environment, and water is the base
of your body’s capacity to transport antibodies, protein, nutrients, hormones, and all-powerful oxygen
through the blood and lymphatic systems.
A 1996 review published in the Biochemistry Journal17 details the deterioration that occurs in a
dehydrated state. Muscle cells starved of water fail to properly metabolize proteins and other
nutrients and can’t properly rebuild themselves. Electrolyte balance is thrown out of whack, and the
electrochemical reactions that govern the movement of amino acids across cells slow down. Chronic
dehydration robs you of energy and muscle.
If the environment in your body is like a California drought, rationing is put into place. Your brain
and body are constantly performing various regulatory mechanisms, and a form of water irrigation is
conducted based on availability and priority. If your body is operating at a deficient level of
hydration and/or electrolyte levels, the brain robs Peter to pay Paul, so to speak. For example, if
there’s rationing going on, the creation of new bone marrow will get the available water, and joint
cartilage will lose out. The same sorts of things happen when electrolytes are running low.
Then there’s the subject of sheer performance loss. A 2 percent drop in your optimal body water
level can enable max VO2 power losses of up to 11 percent. This is because, in a hypo-hydrated state,
your blood gets more viscous and is not delivering as much oxygen. Also, when your total body water
volume is low, there’s going to be less water available for muscle contractions as your
thermoregulation system works harder to keep your body temperature in check. In other words, more
blood goes to your skin and less to your muscle.
Attending to your hydration falls under the No Days Off policy. As a baseline, I recommend that
you take in a bare minimum of 2 to 3 liters per day. If you’re not drinking this amount of water, ideally
most or all of it enhanced with electrolytes, you’re failing one of the easiest and most important
standards.
Take in a bare minimum of 2 to 3 liters of water per day, ideally most or all of it
enhanced with electrolytes.
 
TAKING HYDRATION WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
Here’s a big mistake that athletes trying to hydrate inadvertently make, says Stacy Sims, PhD, an
exercise physiologist and specialist in hydration who started the company Osmo. Hour after hour, they
keep filling up their aluminum wide-mouth water bottles at the drinking fountain. Two weird things
happen: Their trips to the bathroom go through the roof, and they still feel thirsty.
 
Dr. Sims says the thirst is evidence that the body is not absorbing the water. Even if your pee is
clear, you may be suffering from hypo-hydration. The antidote, Dr. Sims says, is a pinch of salt. Mix it
in after you fill up your bottle, and your body’s digestion system will be better able to absorb the
water into your tissues.
The protocol is different at meals. Salt your food (“with simple ol’ iodized salt,” Dr. Sims says),
chase it with pure water, and you’re good to go. Eat a lot of watery fruits and vegetables, too. But
when you’re guzzling water without food, add a pinch of salt.
ADDING FLA
VOR
All you really need to ensure that the water sitting in a bottle on your desk doesn’t pass through you
unabsorbed is a pinch of iodized salt. A $1.50 investment gets you about 26 ounces of Morton’s Salt,
which is going to last you a long, long time in your quest for hydration.
 
If you want more flavor and/or convenience, here are a few options to check out. Studies have
indicated that when there’s more flavor involved, you’re likely to drink more fluid (for more on this,
see T.J.’s Runner to Runner comments on the next page). This is a theory that you can test out for
yourself.
 
Nuun hydration tablets: Nuun was the first antidote to the sugary world of off-the-shelf sports
drinks. Today, these hydration tablets are stocked at a lot of running shoe stores and come in tons
of good flavors. Look for the U Natural or All Day Hydration tabs.
Nutriforce Sports Balanced Hydration powder: (Disclaimer: I helped with the formula on this
one.) In addition to a slate of electrolytes, this powder includes Sustamine, a dipeptide that
combines certain amino acids to optimize absorption.
Camelbak Elixir tablets: These were designed for use in the company’s hydration backpacks,
but you can toss one into a 24-ounce bottle of water and you’re good to go.
Osmo Nutrition: This is Dr. Stacy Sims’ company, and she’s calibrated some of the products to
address the different hydration/absorption needs between men and women.
Runner to Runner
In 1998, I had a conversation with an exercise scientist who worked at the Gatorade Sports Science
Institute in Barrington, Illinois. He was giving me a tour of one of the labs, a room filled with
exercise bikes in which the temperature and humidity could be set to specific numbers. One of the
things he told me made perfect sense: Subjects put on the bikes for long periods, riding in a hot room,
drank more fluid if the drinks they could reach for contained flavor. He also said that if a subject had
a range of flavors to choose from, the athlete seemed to drink even more fluid.
 
In other words, if you’re running 100 miles, you’re more apt to stick with a hydration plan if you
have more than one flavor to choose from. This is obviously going to vary from individual to
individual, but it makes sense. In fact, as the scientist was telling me this, I remembered racing in the
Wildflower half-Ironman triathlon on a really hot day. The aid stations had water and lemon-lime
Gatorade. Halfway through, I was so sick of the taste of lemon-lime that I couldn’t drink any more.
That’s about as anecdotal as it gets, and nowadays in such a race I would pack my own drink tabs and
make my own electrolyte drinks without sugar. But those tabs would probably be a mix of flavors—
especially for a race that lasts hours and hours.
—TJM
are you hydrated or not?
 
If clear urine isn’t a surefire signal that you’re hydrated, how do you know? For about $12, you can
buy 100 urine test strips, like the Rapid Response Urine Dipstick (RRUD), and check to see if you’re
hydrated well enough. You’ll get an amazing amount of information from one dipstick, but the number
you want to look at for optimal hydration is the Specific Gravity (SG) marker. Dr. Stacy Sims
provides this information on how to read the SG marker and know where you stand:
 
 
Normal hydrated status is 1.005 to 1.015.
When you approach 1.020, you’re slipping. Y
ou are about 1 percent down from an optimal
total body water volume.
1.025? That’s even worse. Drink up.
The RRUD strips offer even more objective data for assessing how well you are recovering from
your workouts, which can help you avoid the dreaded state of overtraining. Dr. Sims explains the hard
information you can exact from one test strip:
 
Leukocytes (LEU): No change in color indicates that no leukocytes are present. If positive, the
reagent will turn purple—the severity of the leukocyte presence will be indicated by the
darkness of the purple. If you put in a really hard day of training and the next day the LEU test
shows some purple, it would be prudent to back off for at least a day. Sleep, hydrate, increase
immune-boosting vitamins and minerals, and keep track of your heart rate and leukocytes.
Protein (PRO): Yellow is normal. Any green in the reagent is a positive marker for protein. In
the hours after a workout, it’s normal to see some green. But if you wake up the next day and the
PRO reagent is still showing green, you haven’t fully recovered—a sign that it would be smart
for you to make it an easy day of training or take the whole day off.

CHAPTER 15
STANDARD #12: JUMPING AND LANDING
Q: Can you jump and land with good mechanics?
 
The mastery of jumping and landing with good mechanics is central to the mastery of good running
mechanics. This standard drills deep into the essence of the jumping and landing that running
involves.
 
This is a two-part test: To achieve the standard, you need to be able to jump and land on a box with
good mechanics. Second, you must demonstrate the ability to perform 30 single-leg jump-rope hops
with your left foot and 30 single-leg hops with your right foot.
KEY MOTIV
ATION
If you think of running as a virtually endless series of jumps and landings, then it’s clear that having a
detailed picture of how you jump and how you land is critical for reducing negative forces on your
joints and tissues.
 
recommended mobility exercises for jumping and landing
 
The simplest, and likely the best, way to improve your jumping and landing mechanics is to jump
rope, both double-legged and single-legged. Really tune into how your feet are landing and the path
through which your knees are moving. Also try these exercises:
 
 
Double-Ball Ankle Smash & Strip (see here)
Plantar Mobilizations (see here)
Dorsiflexion Work (see here)
Plantar Flexion Overdrive (see here)
Adductor Smash (see here)
 
BRIEFING
In your journey toward optimal running and optimal running movement, you are probably getting the
big picture of all this: that Band-Aids won’t suffice. If you’re suffering the consequences of a poor set
of ingrained mechanics, crappy motor control patterns, and joint positions that encourage wear-and-
tear, there is no single, magical answer. Minimalist shoes are not a magical answer. Wearing strips of
fashionable athletic tape to get you through a race is not a magical answer. That tape really is a Band-
Aid—one that doesn’t deter the consequences of your actions.
 
To unleash the runner you were born to be, you may have to do a top-to-bottom
overhaul of how you move and think about movement.
 
Rather, to unleash the runner you were born to be, you may have to do a top-to-bottom overhaul of
how you move and think about movement.
Fascia and yoga expert Jill Miller likes to talk about one of the dramatic differences between how
runners think about movement and how dancers think about movement. Dancers, she says, practice
jumps and landings all the time, hours every day, week in and week out. Each time a ballet dancer
launches into a jump, the dancer is thinking hard about every piece of that jump and its landing—
every angle, every firing muscle, every shape, and every detail. The dancer works with a teacher to
address each and every error and perfect that jump.
Until programs like the Pose Method and CrossFit Endurance came along, runners were rarely
taught to drill their awareness into the movement skill of running. The countless jumps and landings
that runners perform in a lifetime were left unanalyzed.
 
With this standard, the idea is to zero in on your jumping and landing mechanics and reset poor
mechanics. Rather than let the mechanics unfold through the sheer force of repetition, I want you to
pay detailed attention to how you pop off the ground and set a new groove—with good patterns and
sound mechanics.
This is an important standard to work on. Yet, like the Ankle Range of Motion standard, it can seem
overwhelming at first—especially if you’ve logged tens of thousands of miles of running. That’s a lot
of time spent sinking yourself into a habitual sequence of movements.
As daunting as such an overhaul might seem, I want to stress that it’s not only worth it, but also
entirely doable. One tip for making these changes is to understand how a swimming coach like Terry
Laughlin, the mastermind behind the Total Immersion program, likes to frame learning how to swim.
First, he notes the complexity, saying, “Swimming is the Rubik’s Cube of movement skill—highly
complex with many interdependent parts.” But then he goes on to explain that learning a highly
complex activity like swimming is a gift that keeps on giving.
If you attend one of Laughlin’s seminars, he is not going to have you jump in the pool, watch you
swim, and then start trying to bend your working stroke into something else. Rather, he works with
swimmers from a blank slate, essentially building a brand-new stroke from the ground up.
This is similar to how I want you to address this standard of learning how to jump and land
correctly. Although jumping and landing might stir up images of that pickup basketball game you
avoid because you’re sure you’ll get hurt, let’s talk about what lies at the essence of jumping and
landing.
When you jump up in the air and land back on your feet, what you’re really doing is performing an
unloaded but dynamic squat. As compared with the action of running—a series of pogo stick–like
unloaded quarter-squats—the core pattern is the same. Of course, the stress of landing after a max
vertical jump is greater, so the opportunity to trash your knees and ankles is higher if your mechanics
are faulty. This is why a basketball player who jumps and lands thousands of times with, for example,
a knee that caves inward upon landing is whittling away at the patellar tendon into jumper’s knee
(another way of saying runner’s knee) or, worse, an ACL tear.
But if you master jumping and landing with good mechanics, you’ll get a feel for good running
mechanics. You will put the critical movement pattern involved in your running under the microscope
and start to lay a new foundation of quality movement—of moving the way your body is designed to
move. And when your body moves the way it’s designed to move, it has an incredible capacity to
deliver power and use good positions to dissipate the stress of landing.
If you master jumping and landing with good mechanics, you will put the critical
movement pattern involved in running under the microscope and start to lay a new
foundation of quality movement—of moving the way your body is designed to move.
 
Effectively transferring the skill of jumping and landing will also pay special dividends in your
downhill running or running down steps—situations in which impact stress increases.
POOR JUMPING AND LANDING TECHNIQUE
Let’s start by talking about what you don’t want and why you don’t want it.
 
Consider sports that involve lateral movements and lots of jumping. If a volleyball or basketball
player is jumping and landing with poor mechanics—let’s say that his knees collapse inward each
time he lands—the stress on his knee complex sets him up to incur one of the more than 250,000 ACL
injuries per year in the United States. A good way not to end up a statistic is to jump and land well.
Good mechanics are the best medicine.
Some of the faults seen in poor jumping and landing mechanics are essentially the same as the
faults seen in poor squatting technique (see here). Of course, unlike squatting, where you’re
stationary, the expression of damage comes much more quickly when you’re colliding with the ground
with the force of three or more times your body weight. These faults include:
 
Knees forward and shins not vertical. You lose connection with your posterior chain and
hammer your knees.
Toes pigeoned inward or fanned outward, duck-like. You’re out of good position and ripping
your knees with rotational shear.
Unbraced midline and disorganized lumbar spine. The muscles of your trunk are not engaged,
and your pelvis is in a sloppy position. Power from your posterior chain is lost. Your knees get
hammered, and so does your lower back.
If you’ve been getting away with any of these faults and continue to practice them, it’s only a matter
of time. The bill will show up in the mail, and you will have to pay.
TEST #1: JUMPING ONTO A BOX
Jumping onto a box—whatever size you’re comfortable with—is a great exercise for working on your
jumping and landing mechanics. Shoot video of your work, or have a friend give you real-time
feedback on what you’re doing.
 
 
Starting position: Load your hips and hamstrings.
 
Y
our knees, feet, and back are neutral. Power is coming from your posterior
chain.
 
Land with your knees and feet straight.
 
Drive your knees outward on landing.
 
 
A good landing: knees are driving outward, feet are
neutral, and arches are activated.
 
FAULT #1: knees collapsing inward.
 
FAULT #2: open feet. Notice how the arches of the
feet and the knees are collapsing.
 
TEST #2: SINGLE-LEG JUMPS
For this test, you perform 30 single-foot skips with a jump rope, with both your right leg and your left
leg, all with good mechanics.
 
Jumping rope is not only an Autobahn to put to use in reworking your jumping and landing
mechanics; it’s also a great way to build strength in your feet. It makes a great warm-up for your runs,
too. Triple the power!
 
Use your hips to power your jumps.
 
Keep a neutral position throughout, from your head through your
shoulders through your feet.
 
Land on your forefoot and allow your heel to lightly kiss the ground
before popping up.
 
 
Runner to Runner
 
Working with a jump rope is one of the best ways to prepare your feet and lower legs for replacing
heel-striking with a forefoot or mid-foot strike. As Kelly says, it may be the simplest and most
straightforward way to strengthen your feet and ankles. My suggestion is to use your jump-rope work
as a way to assess your imbalances. One thing I didn’t notice when I did jumps with both feet was that
my left ankle was considerably weaker than my right ankle. The single-leg jumps were the truth test
on this one. I couldn’t do a single one-legged jump with my left leg when I started—just trying
smarted.
 
—TJM
 
Each of the 30 landings for each leg must be with your foot straight
and your knee in a neutral position.
FAULT: collapsing arch and valgus knee.
PART 3
You are a system of systems. Knee pain, back pain, and arch pain are not independent issues—they
are specific expressions of problems that have multidimensional properties within the body. In being
truly Ready to Run, it is essential that you understand and apply this concept.
 
How do you do this? After you’ve tested yourself against the 12 standards, you will have a working
picture of where your body, your lifestyle, and your habits stand. You will know what your strengths
are—a valuable confirmation—and, more importantly, you’ll have clear evidence of your
weaknesses. This is where the money is—in turning your weaknesses into strengths that will fully
prepare you for both the joy and the rigor that running well has to offer. Let’s get started.
CHAPTER 16
INTRODUCTION TO MOBILITY WORK
 
Testing how you fare against the 12 standards will present you with a working snapshot of how Ready
to Run you are, but, more importantly, it will help you pinpoint your major weaknesses. These known
shortcomings are what I refer to as your goats. In the context of Ready to Run, a goat can be any of
these four types:
 
 
A lifestyle issue (such as not standing with neutral feet)
A mobility issue (such as poor hip extension)
A position issue (such as being unable to squat well)
An issue of mechanics (such as poor jumping and landing technique)
As you’ve no doubt concluded by now, these different types of goats are interrelated. If you live
your life wearing high-heeled shoes (a lifestyle issue), for example, it can have a direct effect on your
joint mobility, which can affect your mechanics.
I often see this pattern with runners and other athletes who are struggling with poor performance,
injuries, or both.
 
By keeping your focus on the 12 standards, you are addressing a set of exceptionally important
targets that will place you on a trajectory toward being able to run well and enjoy an athletic life free
from the sorts of chronic injuries that drive many runners toward psychosis.
So what’s next? You have tested your 12 standards. You passed certain standards and didn’t pass
others.
First of all, I want you to consider any test that you failed reason to celebrate. Not wearing
compression socks? Sweet, that’s an easy one. Your ankle range of motion sucks? Fantastic. The
answer isn’t at easy as buying a new pair of socks, but it’s an opportunity nonetheless.
Celebrate the opportunity. It is performance just lying there waiting for you to grab it. With each
goat on your list, you have a specific and worthy goal shimmering on the horizon, waiting for you to
chase it. It may take time and persistence, because enhancing your mobility and improving your
mechanics are not overnight affairs, but by making progress toward these targets, you will earn better
performance and increased durability.
Falling short on any of the standards is an opportunity to celebrate—it is performance
just lying there waiting for you to grab it.
 
So how do you work toward a perfect Ready to Run score?
First, look at your report card and circle the standards that you’re falling short on.
LIFESTYLE/ADAPTATION STANDARDS
 
Neutral feet
Flat shoes
Warming up and cooling down
Compression
Hydration
MOBILITY/MOTOR CONTROL STANDARDS
 
Supple thoracic spine
Squatting technique
Hip flexion
Hip extension
Ankle range of motion
No hotspots
Jumping and landing
Now that you’ve identified your goats, you’re ready to jump into action. With the
lifestyle/adaptation standards, you can change things like hydrating properly, warming up and cooling
down, and wearing compression socks today. If you’ve been wearing shoes with built-up heels, you
will need to patiently work your way toward wearing flat shoes (use the 10 percent plan described
here). Making neutral feet a habit will also take time, but it too is something toward which you can
make big strides in a matter of hours.
A great thing about diving into correcting lifestyle/adaptation errors is that it will support your
work on improving on your mobility/motor control shortfalls. The direct work of improving on each
of the mobility and motor control standards is the focus of the rest of this book.
IMPROVING YOUR MOBILITY
: A STRATEGIC APPROACH
When it comes to performing maintenance, there is no one-size-fits-all program for runners. As
you’ve probably gleaned by now, the aches and pains that can interfere with running well can be
created by myriad forces, from an inability to get into good positions to specific tissue problems, like
an inflamed heel. What you need is a system that you can use to attack your particular issues—a
system that prioritizes fixing the underlying problems but also addresses the nagging symptoms.
 
Even better, this systematized approach should be a concrete, everyday discipline (like brushing
and flossing your teeth) so that you can prevent problems altogether, well before pain and injuries
surface.
Whether you’re a distance runner, a sprinter, or a soccer player or you’re training for the CrossFit
Games, pursuing and achieving the 12 Ready to Run standards offers you the benefit of preventing
injuries that you might otherwise be destined for. Rather than waiting for a tendon strain or an
inflamed knee to crop up in order to communicate to you that you are doing something wrong, create
an injury prevention discipline by spending 10 to 20 minutes a day working to make your weaknesses
strengths and by using good mechanics not just when you’re training, but throughout your day. This
discipline, or system, is far more productive than the whack-a-mole game that many athletes get into,
where they desperately try to stamp out symptoms rather than deal with the underlying causes.
For your mission to achieve the 12 standards, the mobility exercises outlined in Chapter 17 are
surgical instruments designed to instigate change. Your test results will show you where you’re
currently deficient. Again, these are your goats. The mobilizations are designed to unglue these areas
of restriction and compromised tissue.
 
I want to emphasize that daily attention to mobility work is just one aspect of the Ready to Run
construct. It’s one part of a three-part approach:
 
1. Lifestyle. Make sure that your lifestyle choices are in order. Proper hydration, flat shoes,
compression socks, neutral feet at all times—remember to attend to these simple yet powerful
disciplines.
2. Mobility. Make sure that you are working toward or maintaining the mobility standards, like hip
extension and ankle range of motion.
3. Mechanics. Make sure that you are jumping, landing, and squatting correctly. With lifestyle and
mobility humming along well, you have the ability to get into and practice good positions and
good mechanics. From here, you can further refine your mastery of running by taking on the Pose
Method or a similar running-form technique.
Before you begin your work on developing optimal mobility for running, I want to talk you through
the essential principles for getting the most out of these 10 minutes a day.
MOBILITY WORK: GUIDING PRINCIPLES
As you commit yourself to achieving the 12 standards, use the following principles to guide your
work.
 
 
AT LEAST 10 MINUTES A DAY
I advise my athletes to strive for 20 minutes or more per day of mobility work, but I also know
that a typical day in the modern world can run amok. So what I’m asking of you is a blood
commitment to at least 10 minutes a day, every day. You can make incredible progress toward
achieving the mobility standards with a mere 10 minutes per day. It’s only 10 minutes, but it
needs to be 10 minutes charged with purpose. Pick a target area for the day, be it your feet, your
hamstrings, or your glutes, and pepper that area with mobility work.
No matter what, get that 10 minutes in every day. But I also want you to take those spare
moments you have during the day to squeeze in a little extra Couch Stretch time (see here), or
mobility work on your feet, or time spent in a squat position. I want you to work toward netting a
full 20 minutes a day of quality mobility and tissue work. But first and foremost, get in your 10
minutes.
TWO MINUTES OR MORE
Spend two minutes of dedicated work on each mobilization. Two minutes is the minimum amount
of time you need to effect real change in your tissue. If your mobilization of the day is the Couch
Stretch, for example, then perform the Couch Stretch for two minutes on the right side and then
two minutes on the left side. You’ll notice a change. Just two minutes does wonders. But it has to
be a focused two minutes. If you see people at the gym haphazardly lazing back onto foam
rollers while they read emails on their phones, they are not mobilizing. You’re much better off
spending two targeted minutes working intently with a specific mobilization than rolling around
without focus for 20 minutes.
To make your daily mobility time count, pick one or two mobilizations and go in with total
purpose. To effect real change, you need to work smartly and deeply, searching for knots and
particularly tight areas. Two minutes for each mobilization can be very effective, but you must
work with focus and concentration.
WORK UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM
To make real improvements on your goats, work upstream and downstream of the problem. In
other words, if a certain area, joint, or muscle, be it your ankle, knee, hamstring, hip, or lower
back, is a source of injury or is preventing you from attaining a standard, then, in addition to
using V
ooDoo Floss Band compression (see here) on the area or taking a lacrosse ball to the site
of pain or restriction, you have to develop some slack around the problem. Sure, you want to
work directly on the hotspot or restricted area, but you also want to work above and below the
problem. Why? Because it helps you create slack around the joint or tissue hotspot.
If you have terrible ankle range of motion, for example, then dedicate some of your mobility
time to working below the problem area (your arches, your toes, and the tops of your feet) and
above the problem area (your calf muscles, your knees, and even your upper legs and hips).
IF IT FEELS SKETCHY
, IT IS SKETCHY
If you’re mobilizing and really pushing it, you may get a pain signal that is less about the stress
being placed on the muscle tissue and more about hitting a nerve in a bad way. So here’s the
rule: If it feels sketchy, it is sketchy. Back off and go about the mobilization in a different way.
For example, behind the knee is a neuromuscular bundle that you might come in contact with
while you’re doing leg flexion work, working a lacrosse ball like you might use a nutcracker.
Spots like these sometimes send up spots of weird, nervy pain. This is the time to back off.
While you want to push deep and peel back layers of discomfort with your mobility work, if the
signal coming from your body says, “This is wrong,” then it is wrong.
BE CREATIVE
The mobility exercises that I outline in this book are starting points. Don’t be contained to the
mobilizations. As you’ll note in many of the descriptions, I want you to poke around and seek out
hidden areas that are especially trashed. Try different tools and techniques to sort things out.
Have fun with it, and always work with intent.
For example, say your plan is to spend your 10 minutes on your calves. You’ve been doing
some fast running on the track or shuttle running in a CrossFit workout, and your gastrocs are
smoked. So one of your mobilizations for the day is to perform a Calf Smash with a lacrosse
ball. You start by placing the ball in the belly of your calf and smashing it into the hotspot for
two minutes. But then you start hunting, playing around with looping a stretch band around your
foot, still working with the ball smashed to the ground under your calf. You then riffle through
some of the techniques laid out in the following section, like contract-relax and pressure wave.
Let your intuition lead you into new techniques and combinations of techniques.
USE GOOD POSITIONS
Pay attention to your posture and positions when you work on mobilizations. Keep a braced
neutral spine (see here), and don’t let your knees collapse inward. As I stress throughout this
book, you must follow this principle throughout your day, not just during your workouts. You’re
an athlete 24 hours a day. If you’re able to spend less time sitting at the office, for example,
that’s less time spent in a bad position that yields tissue problems, meaning that you’ll be able to
cut back on the amount of mobilizing you might be doing to counter those sitting-related
problems. Tune into your mechanics and try to be in a good position all the time. Your running
will reap powerful benefits.
NO DAYS OFF
There’s a bad habit that some runners have. I’ve brought it up before, but it’s worth mentioning
again here because it’s so crucial to establishing an effective maintenance program. It’s the bad
habit of finishing a workout and leaving your identity as an athlete behind until the next time you
train. This habit is exhibited in the runner who polishes off a 6-mile morning run and then heads
to the office to spend the rest of the day slightly slumped in a chair, or walks around with poor
mechanics, knees caving in or shoulders slumped forward. It’s like working hard to use good
form for five sets of deadlifts, then sitting down on the ground to rest between sets and using the
crappiest mechanics imaginable to get up.
The No Days Off policy is a mindset, and it starts with the understanding that your muscles
mold around the positions you use most. If you spend a good part of your day sitting in a chair,
then your muscles and joints are going to sway toward that flexed position. The time you clock in
bad positions throughout the day tends to leak into the positions and mechanics you favor while
running.
The antidote is make it a habit to constantly scan the positions you’re using. The more you use
good positions and move with good mechanics, the more your running will benefit. Every
movement and position you use counts, whether you’re 18, 25, 43, or 75.
Think of it this way: Every few years, you check your mailbox and there it is: a new credit
card to replace your old one. You open the envelope and take out the new card. Before you peel
off the sticker, you grab your phone and make the activation call. After that, you have one more
job: to extract the old credit card from your wallet and commit to the act of destruction.
It’s not easy—you bend that credit card in half once, and then repeat by bending it the other
way, back and forth and back and forth. Amazing how resilient it is, isn’t it? Credit cards are
built to take abuse.
And so are you. If you think of each performance of a flawed gait cycle of running like a back-
and-forth bend of a credit card, your tissues can handle a tremendous number of reps. One day,
though, as surprising as it might be, a slight tear occurs in your tissues, just as a slight crack
appears in the credit card.
There are no days off when it comes to maintenance. Even on the busiest of days,
you can commit to finding 10 minutes for mobility work.
 
You keep going because you can. But one day, the tissue gives. As the credit card ultimately
breaks in half, a hole is worn into your knee, or a disc gives out.
This is an essential metaphor to support the No Days Off policy. While taking an occasional
day off from training is prudent and built into most running programs, there are no days off when
it comes to maintenance. Even on the busiest of days, you can commit to finding 10 minutes for
mobility work.
Why? Because each minute you invest in movement and mobility work helps prevent and
reduce the minute wreckage that occurs with each step of running. That damage isn’t a big deal
on its own, but multiply it by a million, and you’ve just pushed that old credit card into an
industrial shredder.
Commit to never taking a day off from your maintenance work. To do so, build maintenance
work into your daily routine.
Many of the mobilizations presented in this book require little tweaking to be made a part of
the regular flow of your day. Use the Couch Stretch (see here) while you’re watching TV
, for
example. Or set a timer to go off every hour, reminding you to get out of your chair and walk
around, sip some water, and maybe perform a good calf mob or drop into a deep one-minute
squat.
TECHNIQUES
At my mobility clinics, I want the participants to leave with a set of tools that enable them to cover all
the necessary groundwork in the pursuit of optimal mobility. Like a craftsman has specific techniques
for specific jobs, or a golfer needs woods, irons, and a putter, athletes and coaches need a set of
mobilization techniques that cover the gamut of their needs. You need a different technique for
improving the position of your hip joint than you do for a patch of sticky sliding surfaces in the arch of
your foot, for example.
 
The following are the core techniques that I teach in my mobility system. Many of them can be used
in combination, like a one-two punch. For example, if you want to address a hotspot deep in your
hamstring, it is a good time to use both a pressure wave and a contract-relax move, one after the other.
This sort of multifaceted attack will help you achieve the best results with a minimal investment of
time. The tools you’ll use to execute these techniques are covered in the section “Your Mobility
Toolbox,” beginning here.
 
SMASH
The smash is a compression-based plumb-bob technique. In other words, it enables you to get a
look into what’s going on in the depths of your tissues. To perform a basic smash, place a ball or
roller on the area you wish to work, take a breath, let it out, and allow your muscles to relax
around the mobility tool. As you’ll see, many of the mobilization techniques start off with a
smash.
CONTRACT-RELAX
You’ve probably heard of contract-relax: It’s an established neuromuscular technique that does
wonders to improve range of motion. Here’s an example of how you might use contract-relax: If
you hit a hotspot with the basic smash, it’s natural for your body to respond by tensing that
muscle. You counter by contracting the muscle with an inhale and then relaxing the muscle with
an exhale, allowing the ball or roller to sink deeper into the tissue. Repeat this process several
times. The contract-relax technique enables mechanisms that will relax away this tension and
permit you to go deeper into the problem area, interacting with trigger points and generating
relief. You can also use it when you’re working on muscle tissues in end-range positions by
tensing the muscle for a few seconds, then relaxing the muscle for a few seconds, then deepening
the position. Repeat this process several times.
Contract-relax is a good technique for improving sliding surface function as well. When
you’re using a ball on a specific spot—say, your heel cord—to improve the sliding surfaces
within the tissue, press deep with the ball, then contract your foot into a flexed position for a few
seconds. Then relax your foot, press the ball deeper, and repeat.
PRESSURE W
AVE
The pressure wave is for pinpointed work and is highly effective for deep-tissue needs, like a
deep knot in your hip. To do it, place a ball or roller on the spot you intend to work, then use
your body weight to sink the ball deep into the tissue. Again, you’re using a basic smash. Then
slowly move the tissue back and forth across the ball or roller, creating a pressure wave. This
move is akin to a Rolfer sinking an elbow into your hip and then moving it back and forth across
the knot.
STRIPPING
Stripping is simply using a ball or roller along the grain of muscle tissue to comb through the
various fascias and fibers. The key with this maneuver is to work very slowly. If you bust out a
roller, lie on it, and then move at the speed of a pinball, you’re going to accomplish absolutely
nothing of value.
Say you decide to strip your quads. Start off with a smash to get good and deep into the tissue,
and then ever so slowly roll through the muscle from above your knee to your hip bone. It should
feel like shoveling through a layer of wet snow.
SMASH AND FLOSS
Let’s revisit sliding surfaces briefly. Your body is a vast network of interconnected tissues. In
the physical therapy world, the term “regional interdependencies” is often used to describe how
we need to consider a spectrum of muscles and tissues within and surrounding a hotspot when
we go about treating a patient. When I talk about restoring sliding surfaces, I’m talking about
dealing with sticky, matted-down tissues that ultimately impair your range of motion. For
example, let’s say that your standards tests showed that you have extremely poor range of motion
in your ankles. Restoring the sliding surfaces is going to be a key component of opening up those
ankles.
 
Smash and floss is a vital technique for restoring the natural glide that should exist between
layers of skin, muscle, nerves, and fascias that can get all bundled up. The basic smash and floss
goes like this: You use the smash technique to position a ball or roller deep in the tissue. In the
ankle example, imagine you’re placing the ball in the muscle of your lower calf. Then you begin
the flossing by moving your foot and ankle through as much range of motion as you can muster,
back and forth. This movement flosses the ball through the tissues and helps you restore slide
and glide.
GLOBAL SHEAR
So far I’ve been talking a lot about moves that zero in on a specific location. Global shear is
designed to rake through large muscles or a range of muscles all at once. For example, say you
want to work on your thoracic spine mobility. You can do some great detail work with a ball, but
it might be helpful to start by using a roller to shear up and down your back to create some
general release and warm up the tissue for the deeper work to come.
FLEXION GAPPING
Flexion gapping is a specific joint-capsule technique to address a tight, gummed-up knee. You
simply put a ball or rolled-up towel behind your knee and then pull your leg into full flexion.
The gap created by the ball or towel creates a force that can help you develop full range of
motion.
TACK AND TWIST
Tack and twist is another great move for restoring sliding surface function. You smash a ball—
preferably a softer ball that has some grippiness to it—into the tissue to tack things down and
then give the ball a twist. This technique helps you brush through stiff tissue as well as move
blood into areas where circulation is relatively weak, like the heel cord.
BANDED FLOSSING
Flossing basically means moving a limb back and forth or side to side. For the banded flossing
technique, you loop a heavy-duty band around a joint or muscle—say, around your high
hamstring—and then begin moving your leg through a squat or lunge. Adding banded flossing to
a mobilization enables you to gain additional range of motion, in this case by helping you reset
your hip capsule.
VooDOO FLOSS BAND COMPRESSION
I covered V
ooDoo Floss Band compression in the No Hotspots standard (see here), but it’s so
valuable for athletes that I want to review it here as well. V
ooDoo Floss Band compression is a
pathway to create a high-powered shearing effect on a tissue hotspot, chunk of scar tissue, or
compromised joint. Wrapping a band around the area returns sliding surface function to the area,
and, after you take off the band, blood flows into those joints and tissues. Muscle contraction
improves, joint mobility improves, and sliding surfaces are refreshed. V
oodoo Compressing a
swollen joint forces the swelling back into the lymphatic system, where it can drain from the
body.
To do V
ooDoo Floss Band compression, you use a compression band—or you can use a
deflated bike tire cut in two. Start below the target area and wrap toward your heart, with a half-
inch overlap of each loop and about 50 percent stretch in the band. Cover all the skin as you
wrap up and over the target area, increasing the tension of the wrap to 75 percent in the target
area itself. With the band wrapped around the joint or hotspot, spend time moving your foot or
leg throughout its range of motion. This can suck a bit, but embrace it. After a few minutes,
unwrap and take some time to recover. Then repeat after a few minutes.
If you are using V
ooDoo Floss Band compression to help restore sliding surfaces, aim for at
least two sessions. If you are using it to counter swelling and inflammation from a more acute
injury, then shoot for a minimum of five sessions, with a maximum of 10.
don’t ice
One of the things that’s become crystal clear, both in the clinical research on the topic and in the
practice of top professional sports leagues, is that using ice with the intention of healing an injury is
counterproductive.
Will ice numb an area and decrease pain? Yes—but at a specific cost. Applying ice to an inflamed
area not only numbs the pain, but also shuts off communication between the muscles and nerves. The
upshot? The flow of the lymphatic system—the all-powerful system in your body that does the healing
—is reversed.
Here’s an example of what the scientific literature has to say about the effect of icing:
“When ice is applied to a body part for a prolonged period, nearby lymphatic vessels begin
to dramatically increase their permeability (lymphatic vessels are ‘dead-end’ tubes which
ordinarily help carry excess tissue fluids back into the cardiovascular system). As
lymphatic permeability is enhanced, large amounts of fluid begin to pour from the
lymphatics ‘in the wrong direction’ (into the injured area), increasing the amount of local
swelling and pressure and potentially contributing to greater pain.”18
 
Gary Reinl of Marc Pro is an expert on the subject of icing and a consultant to a who’s-who list of
trainers for top professional sports teams. “Icing congests the tissues,” Reinl says, and points out that
not a single medical textbook or clinical study supports the use of icing to heal injuries.
Using ice or ibuprofen (which Reinl says is even worse than icing) with the intention of preventing
inflammation is a mistake. “Why would you want to do that?” he asks. In other words, why would you
want to try to take over the regulation of the inflammatory response when the inflammatory response
is a necessary stage in healing?
Here’s my main point: Without inflammation, healing cannot occur.
What helps the lymphatic system do its job? It’s the exact opposite of the first step of the RICE
protocol (rest, ice, compression, elevation): movement rather than rest. Movement helps the
lymphatic system begin the process of restoring the tissues. The next time you turn your ankle or pick
up some inflammation in your knee, instead of reaching for the ice, give V
ooDoo Floss Band
compression and movement of the limb a complete test/retest.
Why has using ice to treat athletic injuries been so common over the last few decades? Reinl
believes that it started back in the 1960s on NFL sidelines. Ice was cheap and easy to get, and it
stopped the pain. But to this day there is no clinical research supporting the method.
Don’t take my word for it: Check it out for yourself. For more information, read Reinl’s book,
Iced! The Illusionary Treatment Option (Amazon Digital Services).
 
YOUR MOBILITY TOOLBOX
With $10 and a trip to a garage sale or thrift store, you can get a great start on building a world-class
mobility gym. Or you can make do with even less. Grab some common items from your garage,
kitchen, and closets, and you can start mobilizing within the hour. A wine bottle. A barbell. A section
of pipe. A softball. A baseball. A golf ball. A half-deflated soccer ball. A punctured bike tire tube.
Any of these household items can be used for mobility work.
As you deepen your practice, there is plenty of useful stuff to buy. Or not. The most important thing
is to do the work. A consistent practice is an effective practice. If you blow $200 on rollers, balls,
and mobility devices but abandon them in the garage, they’re worthless.
With that in mind, the following are the tools that I believe are worth investing in when you’re
ready to upgrade from the stuff you find around the house.
 
ROLLER
Good for: contract-relax, pressure wave, stripping, smash and floss, global shear
You probably already have a foam roller or have access to a foam roller at the gym—they’ve
become ubiquitous. To be blunt, I think foam rollers are fine for beginners and children, but to
effect the kind of change an athlete needs for top performance, you need a tool that can penetrate
deeper into your tissues and create more shear. But you do need some type of roller. Opt for
something with a little more bite to it, like the Rumble Roller (a roller made with rubber teeth),
a pipe, or a barbell.
BATTLESTAR
Good for: contract-relax, pressure wave, stripping, smash and floss, global shear
An extreme upgrade to the standard foam roller. I like to equate the Battlestar with what you’d
get if you combined a chainsaw, a wolverine, and a steamroller. I designed this tool to execute
both the global shearing of a hard foam roller and acute, detailed raking work. (Available at
www.roguefitness.com)
LACROSSE BALLS
Good for: contract-relax, pressure wave, stripping, smash and floss, flexion gapping
Lacrosse balls are firm enough that they can sink deep into your tissues. Even if they are all you
have, you can do some incredible mobility work. You can pick up a few lacrosse balls at the
nearest sporting goods store. Each ball is going to set you back about two bucks.
A double-lacrosse-ball setup is especially valuable for working on your shins and your
thoracic spine. Take two lacrosse balls, grab a roll of athletic tape, loop the tape two or three
times around both balls at once, and then wrap the tape around the center between the two balls.
You’re ready to mobilize.
YOGA TUNE UP THERAPY BALLS
Good for: contract-relax, pressure wave, stripping, smash and floss, tack and twist
From fascia and pain relief expert Jill Miller, these balls are about the same size as lacrosse
balls, but are softer and have a stickier surface. They give you a different spin on the techniques
for which you could also use a lacrosse ball, but they’re especially useful for tacking and
twisting tissues, such as those on the top of your foot, and breathing some life into your fascias.
A pair, as pictured, comes with a tote bag, so you can use it as you would a double-lacrosse-ball
setup. (Available at www.yogatuneup.com)
ALPHA BALL
Good for: contract-relax, pressure wave, stripping, smash and floss, tack and twist
Another of Jill Miller’s tools, this ball is 3.5 inches in diameter, a bit soft, and a bit sticky, so
it’s good for hotspot work when you’re trying to unglue stuck sliding surface tissue and you may
be putting some weight into your skeleton. (Available at www.yogatuneup.com)
GEMINI
Good for: smash, contract-relax, stripping, smash and floss
I started off with the double-lacrosse-ball setup for work on the T-spine, where it’s ideal for
blocking off the facet joints, but this tool provides more detail and grip to get a little more out of
targeted trigger point work. (Available at www.roguefitness.com)
SOFTBALL
Good for: smash, contract-relax, pressure wave, stripping, smash and floss
Sometimes you need an object larger than a lacrosse ball to get where you need to go with a
smash. A softball is to your mobility work what a fat Sharpie marker is to your selection of
writing tools. It’s especially good for smashing into the large glute muscles.
SUPERNOV
A
Good for: smash, contract-relax, pressure wave, stripping, smash and floss
An upgrade on the softball, the Supernova was invented to dole out a much higher percentage of
grip and shear when working into a deep pocket of tissue, like the hip or hamstring. The teeth of
the Supernova are designed to separate the many layers of tissue that you need to penetrate for
optimal mobilization. (Available at www.roguefitness.com)
SOCCER BALL
Good for: smash, contract-relax, global shear
Rather than explain this, I think it’s best that you just try it. You’ll instantly get the message. Get
your hands on a soccer ball at a garage sale or thrift store, or raid your kid’s closet. Let out some
of the air, and then sprawl on top of the ball so that it hits you in the gut. Then begin rolling
around. At some point, you’ll trip over your psoas, the long muscle running through half your
body that is responsible for flexing your hip, among other things. In athletes—especially athletes
who run a lot—the psoas gets incredibly tight, setting off a wide range of mobility troubles.
Performing the smash with a deflated soccer ball is your new secret weapon toward meeting the
Hip Flexion, Hip Extension, and Efficient Squatting Technique standards.
 
COREGEOUS BALL
Good for: smash, contract-relax, global shear
This is a high-end upgrade on a half-deflated soccer ball. Jill Miller’s inflatable 9-inch ball has
the added value of being a little bit sticky, so you can tack the ball into a spot and work on the
dreaded psoas. (Available at www.yogatuneup.com)
 
ROGUE MONSTER BAND
Good for: contract-relax, banded flossing
This robust rubber band is especially valuable when your mobility work of the day is targeting
your hamstrings and glutes. (Available at www.roguefitness.com)
 
VOODOO FLOSS BAND
Good for: V
ooDoo Floss Band compression
The V
ooDoo Floss band is engineered for therapeutic compression on hotspots and swollen
joints, as detailed in the No Hotspots standard. A household alternative is to splice a bike tire
tube lengthwise. (Available at www.roguefitness.com)
 
AB MAT
An ab mat is a good all-around tool to have in your mobility toolkit. You’ll use it for the Couch
Stretch (see here), but it’s always good to have on hand if you require some extra cushion or
support for your lower lumbar spine. (Available at www.roguefitness.com)
going deep
At the heart of Ready to Run is a single, guiding mission for athletes: You have to go deep. If you wait
until something hurts, you’re acting way too late.
Typically, runners and other athletes do their sport until one day—wham—they wake up to
discover that their knee hurts, or their Achilles tendon is sore, or they have a hamstring tear.
At this point, the athlete swoops into action, treating the symptoms with ice, ibuprofen, and the like,
waiting for the pain to go away and then springing back into action.
This is the classic treat-the-symptoms approach. In the Ready to Run system, treating symptoms is
part of the game plan, sure (V
ooDoo Floss Band compression is an important action to take when you
have swelling and pain in a joint or tissue—see here), but it’s secondary to treating the root cause.
The root cause can always be found in either your ability to get into good positions (your mobility,
particularly in regard to your ankles, knees, and hips) or your motor control patterns (your mechanics,
such as the patterns you habitually use when you jump and land).
By periodically testing yourself on the 12 standards, you can usually stop an injury in its tracks
long before it is expressed. If you can’t squat well or you don’t have normal, healthy hip flexion or
extension, that’s an alert that an injury is waiting to get a hold of you someday. It’s also a sign that
you’re leaking away energy and power that could be better used toward performance.
Some people might argue that because the act of running itself uses a relatively limited range of
motion, developing the range of motion and capacity to get into good positions is excessive. The logic
goes that to be a runner, you really don’t need to get into a full squat, and you don’t really need the
amount of ankle range of motion and hip function called for in the Ready to Run standards.
But for me, it’s about having a buffer. When you need to jump in the car and do a solid piece of
driving to take care of an errand or make a meeting, isn’t it nice to have a full tank of gas? Sure, you
could probably make it there and back on a quarter tank, but isn’t the ideal situation the one in which
you know you’ve got it covered?
The same philosophy applies to the mobility standards. By achieving each standard, you can rest
assured that your body is capable of getting into good positions and using good movement patterns.
The tank is full.

CHAPTER 17
MOBILIZATIONS
 
You’ve tested yourself across the 12 standards, and you now have a good idea of what weaknesses (I
call them goats) stand between you and being Ready to Run. The mobility exercises in this chapter
will help you improve on your goats from two directions:
 
 
1. They will help you figure out the source of a weakness and work through that specific
tissue restriction.
2. They will help you create slack around the problem by working upstream and downstream
of the weak area.
These two attacks will help you improve your mobility and eventually turn a goat into a strength.
THE MOBILIZATION WORKOUT
When it’s time to perform your mobility work for the day, how do you proceed? You may know which
Ready to Run standards you need to make progress on, and you may also have a hotspot here or there.
So what’s the protocol?
 
 
1. Work on hotspots first. Did you feel a twinge in your foot or your Achilles near the end of a run
or MetCon? Is you knee a bit stiff and tweaky? The first thing you want to address in your
mobility session is any sign of a hotspot or signal that there may be a hotspot in your future. For
example, let’s say you felt pain creeping around the inside of your knee during a run. This pain
would be the first thing you would attend to in your mobility session. V
ooDoo Floss Band
compression followed by an upstream and a downstream mobilization would be a good plan for
a minor tweaky feeling or ache. If it’s a significant hotspot, dedicate at least 10 minutes to
working on the problem area and upstream and downstream of the problem.
2. Work on a goat. From your test results, pick a goat to work on. Say you are short of the Ankle
Range of Motion standard, for example. Choose one or two of the lower leg mobilizations and
spend at least two minutes per side with each exercise. If you have time, work in an appropriate
upper leg mobilization to get in some upstream work.
3. Do maintenance mobility work. If you still have some time, cycle through another area, either a
second goat or a standard you are already meeting. For example, say you have a supple thoracic
spine. That’s super—let’s keep it that way. Spend two minutes doing some global work on your
upper back.
I want you to invest a minimum of 10 minutes per day, every day, year-round, with this template in
mind. Ten minutes is solid, but if you can find the extra minutes, put in two mobility sessions per day,
or add mobilization time to your warm-up or cool-down, and your improvements will come that much
faster.
LOWER LEG
Calf Smash & Pressure Wave
Working on your calves is a gnarly business. Runners know this—these muscles are short, abused,
and sensitive as hell. The Calf Smash is a good place to start, and it can be a nice mobilization to
throw into your pre-run warm-up. Performing the Calf Smash will likely reveal tight patches and
knots that you didn’t know you had. When you find those, swoop in with the Pressure Wave.
 
Want some extra pressure? Use a sandbag or loaded backpack to perform a Weighted
Calf Smash.
 
Place your calf on top of the roller of your choice, or a pipe or barbell. Use your other leg to
apply some extra pressure and weight.
 
Relax your muscles, breathe, and sink into the roller to connect with your deepest tissues. Now
move into the Pressure Wave, slowly rolling your lower leg from side to side and kneading your
way into the tissues.
 
Contract and relax the tissues by flexing and extending your foot through its full range of
motion.
Banded Ankle Mob 1
Using a band is a powerful technique for maintaining the health and position of a joint capsule. It also
helps revive sticky sliding surfaces. In fact, the pounding that athletes take from running often results
in skin being stuck to the Achilles tendon, which, unsurprisingly, can create problems. If the tissues
around your heel cords are beat to hell, take a band and loop one end around a post and the other end
around your heel. Move out to create as much tension in the band as you can. Keep your foot flat on
the ground throughout this mobilization. Test your ankle range of motion before and after to register
any change.
 
 
Hook a Rogue Monster Band around your heel.
 
Keeping your foot flat on the ground, drive your knee forward
and out. Do not to let your knee collapse inward.
 
Oscillate back and forth to restore the sliding tissues around the
joint.
 
Banded Ankle Mob 2
In this variation of the Banded Ankle Mob, you drop your rear knee to the floor, use your hand to push
your other knee outward, and work through the entire ankle—working toward those corners in search
of tight spots to be dealt with. Test your ankle range of motion before and after this mobilization to
see if there’s a change in your tissues.
 
 
Wrap the band around the front of your ankle,
get some good tension in the band, and then
drop your opposite knee to the ground.
 
Use your hand to press your knee outward,
keeping your foot flat on the ground.
Bone Saw Calf Smash
The Bone Saw is a potent way to work on your dorsiflexion range of motion and the fascias within
your feet and ankles. As your ability increases, work through the positions shown in the photos to the
point where you can sit back on your lower leg for optimal pressure. Don’t be surprised if you start
sweating while you’re doing this mobilization—that’s your fascias being challenged.
 
 
Lower yourself so that the front of your ankle
complex is supported by an ab mat or a folded
towel.
 
Cross your opposite ankle on top of the calf
you’re working on.
 
Sit back to apply as much pressure as you can
handle without things getting sketchy. This is
the smash part.
 
This is the saw part—in the photo, my right leg
is sawing into my left calf.
 
 
Y
ou can also move up and down along the tissues, tacking and flossing those matted sliding
surfaces.
 
Move your hips up and down in a contract-relax fashion.
 
Drive your shin up the tissue, looking for knots to destroy.
Superfriend Shear
Working with a partner, you can focus on completely relaxing your body and letting your friend deal
out the pain. Lie down with support underneath the front of your ankle, and have your friend work
back and forth across the tissues of your lower leg.
 
 
Place an ab mat or a folded towel underneath your lower leg as you lie down in a prone position.
Allow your Superfriend to set his foot into position.
 
Have your friend use his foot to work across the tissues near your ankle joint, starting with a
smashing technique into the muscle and then working side to side across the grain of the muscle
fiber.
 
Y
our buddy’s foot can strip the muscle, working slowly up and down the length of the fibers.
Tack, Twist, & Floss
Place a ball on your heel cord and tack down the tissue, and then twist and floss the skin. You can use
a lacrosse ball for this mobilization, but a softer ball with some grippiness to it will enable you to get
a nice twist on the sliding surfaces. I’m using one of Jill Miller’s Yoga Tune Up Therapy Balls.
 
 
Place a Y
oga Tune Up ball or other soft, grippy
ball on the rear of your ankle.
 
Tack down some tissue layers and floss them
by twisting the ball.
 
 
Moving up and down your heel cord, unglue the sliding surfaces by applying pressure, moving
the ball back and forth across the cord, and twisting the tissues.
Lateral Ankle Smash & Floss
Place a ball between the outside of your heel/ankle and the floor. Use one hand to hold the ball in
place and the other hand to move your foot through a full range of flexion to floss the sliding surfaces.
 
ALTERNATE ROTATION: Move your foot from side to side to get some lateral-medial action going.
 
 
Place the ball on the lateral side of your ankle,
applying pressure with your hand.
 
Use one hand to flex and extend your foot
while continuing to press the ball into your
ankle with the other hand.
 
Notice how you can obtain greater depth by
pressing your ankle into the ball and into the
floor.
 
Rotate your foot from side to side as well as up and down. Hunt for spots that help you unglue
the tissues and fascias and open up blood flow to the area.
Medial Ankle Smash & Twist
Your mission here is to breathe some life and sliding surface function into the fascias and tissues on
the medial side (inside) of your ankle. Start with a spot underneath the talus bone.
 
 
Pick a spot near the talus bone on the inside of your ankle.
 
Take a Y
oga Tune Up Ball or other soft, grippy ball like a racquetball and
tack the spot, then use twisting motions.
 
Work throughout the area in search of hotspots of matted-down tissue.
 
After you find a good nugget of tissue to work on, dig in deep and twist.
Two-Ball Smash & Floss
You’ll be working your shins in this mobilization, but keep in mind that this work also does wonders
for your feet, as the two are connected. Think of it like working on puppet strings. Place one ball
between the bones of your lower leg (the lateral compartment) and the floor, and another ball on the
inside of your shin (the anterior compartment). Dig into the tissue from above and below, moving up
and down your shin. Say goodbye to shin splints!
 
Prepare to work along your tibia.
 
While pressing a ball into your tibia with your hands, place another ball between your fibula and
the ground to get a double whammy.
 
Roll the top ball from near your knee toward your ankle.
 
Lift your foot off the ground and contract-relax your ankle to get a deep flossing effect.
 
In addition to flexing and extending your foot, rotate your foot laterally.
 
Place both hands on the top ball to exert maximum force.
 
Work the top ball down your shin. As you move down your tibia, continue flexing and rotating
your foot.
Double-Ball Ankle Smash & Strip
Although acute pains and aches from running can be expressed in the feet, an upstream problem is
often the culprit. All of the tissues that control the movement of your feet are contained in your lower
leg. So if you have arch pain, don’t forget to create some slack by searching for trouble spots in your
shins. This mobilization will dig in and let you know what’s going on.
 
Use a double-lacrosse-ball setup or the Gemini. (In the photos I’m using a pair of Jill Miller’s
Y
oga Tune Up Therapy Balls in their tote.)
 
Using your body weight to exert force, slowly strip the tissue, rolling your shin up and down
between the balls.
FEET AND TOES
Plantar Mobilizations
Using a ball, spend a few minutes working up and down the arch and around your foot. Simply apply
pressure wave motion (see here) using your body weight. Hunt down those messy little knots and
spend some additional time working through that tissue. Are you watching Game of Thrones? It’s a
good time to get in some plantar work as well.
 
ALTERNATE TOOL: Use a roller to get some global shear.
 
The main rule of the game with plantar mobilizations is to actively search for acute
hotspots in your foot and then use twisting forces, pressure waves, and smashes to
invigorate the fascias, muscles, nerves, and other tissues that make up the leaf spring
that is your foot.
Dorsiflexion Work
Nothing says good morning to your toes like loaded dorsiflexion work. In a kneeling position, spend
time rolling back on your toes and waking up the range of motion throughout.
 
Kneel down like a sprinter getting into the blocks, and hold this position to start working the
fascias and muscles of your foot.
 
Work from side to side, back and forth, and give each foot two minutes of love.
Plantar Flexion Overdrive
This one feels as gnarly as it looks. In a kneeling position, use contract-relax movements to invigorate
the fascias in your feet and develop your plantar range of motion.
 
Seat yourself on the ground with one leg fully flexed and your foot in plantar flexion.
 
Lifting at the knee, you’ll notice some rather remarkable fireworks going on in the fascias
throughout the top of your foot.
 
Keep your foot and knee in alignment as you work toward maximum plantar flexion.
 
Hold your max position for two minutes on each side. After mobilizing one foot, check its range
of motion against the range of motion of your other foot to note how much change you have
achieved.
Toe Grip
The Toe Grip is similar to the plantar mobs, but this one really works on strengthening and spreading
out your toes.
 
Open your toes wide.
Grab a ball with your toes like you would try
to pick up a basketball with one hand.
Toe Re-animator
This mobilization is from Kit Laughlin, the creator of Stretch Therapy, and it’s a badass way to wake
up toes that have atrophied from years of wearing overbuilt shoes (see Chapter 5). Splice your fingers
between your toes and work up and down, side to side, and in between. This is another good activity
to complement TV watching.
 
Use the photos as a template for ideas. The primary idea here is to intertwine your
fingers and toes.
UPPER LEG
Adductor Smash
Your adductors are critical to achieving the stabilization you want to achieve each time one of your
feet touches the ground. Runners tend to focus on the hamstrings, IT band, and quads and blow off the
adductors. Your adductors help stabilize your back, so putting in some regular maintenance on them is
going to help you. Use a pressure wave with a roller on the inside of your thigh.
Position your roller on the inside of your thigh and relax into it to get good depth.
Drive the same-side hip toward the floor to deepen the pressure. Explore the adductor
for tight spots to work your way into.
Anterior Hip Smash
This mobilization is an excellent tool to aid you in your pursuit of the standards related to optimal hip
function (see Chapters 8 and 9). It’s also a good way to alleviate lower back pain. Use a ball to
smash your way into the deep tissues on the front and side of your thigh. Spend 10 minutes on one
side, then stand up and compare it to the other side.
 
The starting place for working in these areas of the anterior and high glute is right at the top of
your hip bone. If you’ve been putting in some mileage, the tissues in this area are probably a
mess, and you’ll know right away that you’re going to feel this mobilization in a big way.
 
Press your body weight into the ball, and then roll back and forth through the mashed fibers.
 
Rotate your femur to get some twisting forces into the mobilization. And remember to breathe.
Hamstring Floss
Hamstrings are a runner’s best friend, particularly if you’re using the powerful muscles of your
posterior chain (which is how you should run). Note that hamstrings is plural: You have three
muscles that work together to flex your leg. They all deserve your attention. Using a box or chair and
a roller, pressure wave your way through your hamstrings in search of knots and pockets of tight
tissue. When you find those hotspots, give them special attention.
 
Using a box or other elevated surface on which you can get leverage, place the roller on your
hamstrings.
 
Rotate, flex, and extend your leg to work the tissues from a variety of angles.
Hamstring Smash, Superfriend Version
This mobilization is not unlike a Thai massage—you relax into the ground while your training partner
works up, down, and across your hamstrings.
 
Have your buddy put his bare foot into your hamstring and work deep into and across your
tissues.
 
Be sure that he works up into the high hamstring area.
Knee 360
Does your knee hurt? Using a double-lacrosse-ball setup for the outside and another ball for the
inside, work around and above your knee to relieve the tissues that spend so much time stabilizing the
joint.
 
Pictured on the left, a double-ball setup, and on the right, the Gemini. Y
ou can also tape
together two lacrosse balls.
 
Position the tool so that you can begin working upstream of your knee.
 
Lean back and work through the tissues.
 
Rotate your leg and use a pressure wave.
 
Add a softball or Supernova to the inside of your upper leg to get some additional work around
your knee.
 
Flex and extend your top leg to pressure wave through your adductor issues.
Knee Flexion Gap & Smash
This mobilization is an effective way to unglue the tissues behind your knee. It’s also a great tool for
dealing with tight calf muscles. Fold a ball into your knee joint and then flex your leg. Work through
the tissues by moving your foot around and posting it underneath you to increase the pressure.
 
Seated on the floor, place a ball behind your knee.
 
Flex your leg around the ball to create a compression force into your tissues. Flex and extend
your foot for additional work.
Patellar Smash & Floss
This mobilization (in concert with the other knee mobilizations) can do wonders to release tightness
that is being expressed as pain. Prone on the floor, use a ball and your body weight to unmash the
tissues around your kneecap.
Lie down, place a ball above your knee, and begin exploring the tissues around your
kneecap. Rotate your leg, flex and extend your lower leg and foot, and really unglue
the area.
Quad Smash, Superfriend Version
The benefit of having a friend dole out the mobility pain is that you can lie back, relax, and try to use
mental distraction—think about your upcoming tropical vacation or something like that—while your
tissues get a good lashing.
 
Have your friend put some weight through his foot into your quadriceps.
 
Work across the quad and up and down the front of your femur. Put extra time into those
locations that trigger a pain face.
Quad Smash Roller
With two minutes per side of a deep smash with a roller or Battlestar, you can take care of all the tight
business that your training leaves behind in your quads.
Work above your knee, across all your tissues. Relax into the roller and oscillate back
and forth for an optimal effect.
TRUNK & HIPS
Banded Hip, Single-Leg Squat
This powerful hip opener is great for improving hip extension (see Chapter 9). The band creates a
distraction that will help solve joint capsule restriction problems and enable you to move into a
deeper position. Loop a band around the crease of your hip and walk backward to create as much
tension as you reasonably can. Squeeze your butt and belly and lower your knee to the ground, as
pictured. Repeat.
 
Facing a post, loop a band above your hip crease. Walk backward to get a lot of tension in the
band. Squeeze your glutes as you set yourself up in the position that you would use to dip into a
lunge.
 
With your glutes engaged, belly muscles tight, and torso upright, drop your knee toward the
floor.
 
Return to the start by extending both legs.
Double-Band Hip Distraction
This mobilization is a powerful way to work on resetting the health and vitality of your hip capsule
and a great part of your arsenal in working on your hip extension and flexion (see Chapters 8 and 9).
 
You’ll need two bands for this one. Working on your right leg, loop one band around
the front of your hip and the other around your foot. Now move your right leg both
across your body and to the outside of your body.
Global Gut Smash
Even if you’re using good positions when you run, it’s likely that you’re overworking your trunk due
to the task of stabilizing your trunk. If you’ve ever been to a sports massage therapist who has dug into
your psoas, you know in a visceral way how tight and painful it can be. So work your abs in a global
fashion, but also get the psoas.
 
The psoas is a long muscle that originates in the lower lumbar spine and crosses through to the
lower pelvis. It stabilizes the spine, flexes the hips, and helps generate power through rotation.
Wham. In a runner, it takes a serious beating and gets really tight. Using a large, soft ball (like a half-
inflated soccer ball), lie with the ball underneath your stomach, work through your abdominals, and
also find that psoas (you’ll feel it) and give it some time.
 
Use a deflated soccer ball or the like. I’m using the Coregeous Ball that Jill Miller designed
expressly for this type of work.
 
Lie down on the ball, with the ball placed right in your gut. Take a big breath, hold it in for a bit,
and then let it out, sinking into and around the ball as you relax. This will plumb the depth of
your gut.
 
Work across your stomach, looking for those spots where you feel the heavens part. Contract
and relax to inject some relief into your psoas.
Psoas Smash & Floss
For extra credit in working on your psoas, use a softball to really dig in.
 
Notice the location of the ball on my stomach—this is the pathway you’ll plunge into to get to
the psoas.
 
With your body weight channeled into the ball, work the left and right sides, searching for and
discovering your psoas.
Glute Smash & Floss
A simple ball can penetrate deep into the hard-working muscles of the hip, including the deep rotator
muscles. Optimal hip function is crucial for stability, injury prevention, and power output. The Glute
Smash & Floss can pinpoint and help you attend to buried trigger points and hotspots. Using a softball
or Supernova, place the ball on a box or chair and then sit on the ball. Apply as much weight as you
can as you sift through your hip muscles.
 
Start at the lower hamstrings, just above your knee.
 
On a box, work all the way up to your hips, scouting for knotty tissues along the way.
 
When you find a hotspot, contract and relax those muscles, pressure wave back and forth, and
sink into the tissues. Floss by flexing and extending your leg.
Glute Smash
For more targeted work, use a lacrosse ball on specific knots and floss through them.
 
Place a lacrosse ball or Y
oga Tune Up Ball on your glutes.
 
When you find a particularly nasty area, rotate your leg back and forth across the ball.
Hip Capsule Rotation
Lots of running with poor form can create an impingement at the front of your hip and send you off the
rails with limitations in your ability to walk and run with a neutral foot (see Chapter 4). This
mobilization can help you reset your hip joint. Kneel on the ground with most of your weight on one
knee. Your kneecap should be directly underneath your hip. Drop your hip to the outside and continue
to load the weight on your knee. Move your torso forward and backward.
 
On your hands and knees, shift your weight onto one knee. Make sure that your hip and knee
are aligned.
 
Pivot on your knee, driving your hip toward the ground, as if you were trying to use your femur
to puncture a hole in your hip. This is where you’re really getting into your hip capsule.
 
Move your trunk backward and then forward over your knee to work both ends of your hip
capsule.
Posterior Chain Banded Floss
Using the banded floss technique, this is one of the best ways to maintain strong, healthy hamstrings
and slide and glide within your tissues. The flossing action will help with hip position as well.
 
Facing away from a pole, loop a band around the front of your hip. Step forward to work up
tension in the band. Place your hands on the ground in front of you and begin flexing and
extending your leg.
Single Leg Flexion
This mobilization is a good one for developing and mastering your squatting ability, hip flexion, hip
extension, and overall hip function. It doesn’t require any equipment, which makes it a good choice to
rotate into your schedule when you have a couple of minutes. As you get into the heart of the
mobilization, really work your femur bone around and flatten your back to search for especially tight
knots and corners surrounding your hip capsule, like you’re using a can opener to open things up.
 
With one leg trailing behind you, post your forward foot on the ground.
 
Drop your rear knee and drive your hip toward the ground.
 
Rotate your upper body inward, as pictured. Focus your attention on those spots in your hip that
are especially tight.
 
Press your hand on your knee and drop your opposite elbow toward the ground.
 
Drive with your hand as you extend your torso in the opposite direction.
 
Here’s another look from above. Notice the can opener effect being applied to the hip.
BACK 
Low-Back Ball Smash
Running can wreak havoc on your lower back thanks to all the pounding involved. Maintaining a
neutral, engaged spine is your first order of defense in preventing lower back pain. But even then, you
need to work in time to poke around the tissues and triggers points of your lower back to keep it
healthy and powerful.
 
Place a ball along one side of your spine and lie down on it. Extend the same-side arm above your
head and use your body weight to press into the tightened tissues surrounding the lower lumbar.
 
The target area is adjacent to the lower lumbar. This is where you want to start.
 
This is a smash, so your first task is to lie down on the ball and relax into it. Be sure to breathe.
Use the contract-relax technique to allow even greater reach with the ball.
 
Begin to move around slowly on the ball, creating a pressure wave on any gnarly bits that you
find.
 
Lift your hips off the ground to leverage more body weight onto the ball. Breathe and relax as
you move the ball around your lower back, spending extra time on spots that are tight and
knotted up.
 
Rotate your torso as you roll from side to side through your tissues on the ball.
 
T-Spine Global Smash
If you recall from Chapter 6, many distance runners are messed up when it comes to the upper back
and the flexibility of the thoracic spine. This results in that shoulders-rolling-forward problem that
makes it impossible for athletes to use good posture when they run. It can also result in neck pain,
because the head is usually thrust out in front of the body and has to be stabilized with muscles; the
skeleton isn’t able to do the work it is designed to do.
 
Freeing yourself of this problem starts with opening up your thoracic spine. This mobilization
offers direct work to do so.
Lie with a roller or Battlestar positioned across your T-spine area, cross your arms in
front of you, and globally work the area. Press into the floor with your legs to add to
the bodyweight pressure. Rotate your torso from side to side.
T-Spine Double-Ball Strip
For more specific work along your spine, use a double-lacrosse-ball setup or the Gemini to strip
through the tissues connected to the vertebrae.
 
Place the tool (I’m using the Gemini) over your spine.
 
Lying down on the tool, roll so that it reaches the thoracic spine region. Hug your arms around
your body to reduce the slack.
 
Pushing your feet into the ground and raising your hips, work the tool toward your upper back
and the base of your neck.
 
Stop at each vertebra and work from side to side to unlock the tissue.
SHOULDERS
Anterior Shoulder
If the Supple Thoracic Spine standard is a goat for you, work on the front of your shoulders to help
unshackle you from the poor posture and position that a stiff upper back can destroy you with.
 
This is your target area.
Lay into the front of your shoulder and extend
your arm over your head.
Move your arm into a horizontal position and
press your body weight into the ball.
Wrap your arm around your low back and
press your body weight into the ball.
Banded Bully
As part of your work on your T-spine, work to reset your shoulder joints with this mobilization. Loop
a band around the crease of your shoulder and lean your body weight into it. Turn your head to the
side to deepen the mob.
 
Loop the band around your shoulder and drive away from the post to create tension in the band
and distraction in the joint. Feel your shoulder being pulled back into the joint capsule.
 
Wrap your arm around your lower back and grab it with your opposite hand.
 
Raise your arm out away from your back.
 
Turn your head to the side to get additional flossing of the tissues in the region.
28-DAY SAMPLE MOBILITY OVERHAUL PLAN
 
Every athlete is different, and every athlete has his or her own set of strengths and weaknesses to deal
with. My primary mission as a teacher is—as the saying goes—to teach you how to fish rather than
grill up a plate of salmon for you. My goal is to encourage and empower you with a system of
maintenance that puts you in charge.
 
That said, here is a sample 28-day plan of how you might install the Ready to Run approach into
your life. The idea is to spend at least 10 minutes a day, every day, on solving your mobility
problems. In the course of four weeks, you should visit each area of your body—feet and lower legs,
upper legs, hips and trunk, and upper back—at least once. When it comes to weaknesses you’ve
identified, I want you to drop in even more frequently.
During this 28-day period, you should also be managing your lifestyle issues. Are you hydrating
enough every day? Are you making neutral feet a permanent habit? Are you managing any hotspots that
flare up? These might seem like little extras, but they’re not. It’s these lifestyle errors (I also call them
adaptive errors) that are the source of the river of injuries that drive runners and other athletes crazy.
Remember that if you’re stressed for time, you should search out ways to build mobilizations into
your day. Make them a part of your warm-up or cool-down, and bulldoze through any reluctance to do
mobility work in public—when you’re waiting to board a flight, for example. Don’t be shy. Be
mobile and Ready to Run.
Voodoo Tuesday. Get out your V
ooDoo Floss Band and wrap any hotspot (tired or tender area), be it
your foot, ankle, knee, calf, or hamstring. Spent at least 2 minutes wrapped up and moving the limb
through its full range of motion.
 
Plantar Blitzkrieg. Spend at least 10 minutes dousing your feet with plantar mobilizations: Toe Grip
(see here) and Toe Re-animator (see here). Really bring them back to life.
 
Bracing Sequence Drill. On the hour during your waking hours, stop what you’re doing, check to
make sure that your feet are in a neutral position, and then go through the bracing sequence (see here).
Goat Herding. Refer to your testing and pick out one or more standards that are your goats, or
weaknesses. Perhaps you have upper back mobility issues (Standard #3, A Supple Thoracic Spine) or
wretched heel cords (Standard #7, Ankle Range of Motion), or your squatting technique (Standard
#4) needs work. Dedicate Goat Herding time to working on those weaknesses, knowing that as you
evolve them into strengths, you’ll gain in injury prevention and performance.
 
Barefoot Saturday. Spend as much of the day as you can being barefoot.
 
Lifestyle Supplies Check. Take some time to inventory your mobility tools and assess your need for
flat shoes, compression socks, or electrolytes. Make sure that you have the stuff you need for the
coming week. Also plot out your weekly goal in regard to transitioning to flat shoes (if you haven’t
done so already). See here for a plan to transition smartly and safely.
 
PART 4
You have the mindset, you have the tools, and you have the talent. Where to now? In these final pages,
I want to give you some weaponry. Engaging the 12 standards with focus, lifestyle changes, and
mobility work is your starting point, but the life of an athlete is never without new challenges to
confront, work through, and learn from. Let’s talk a bit about some particular and common injury
problems that running tends to serve up, and about how to get the most value out of the sports
medicine world that’s out there waiting to help as you continue to push the envelope.
CHAPTER 18
ATTACKING COMMON RUNNING INJURIES
 
By now you should understand that running injuries aren’t some mystery of another universe. They are
physics and biology in action. See them as messages about what’s missing in your mechanics, your
range of motion, and your potential to run faster, longer, and better.
 
This chapter will be somewhat of a review of the information presented earlier in this book, but I
want to give you the basic attack plan for several common running injuries so that you can see how
the Ready to Run mobility template can be wielded against any chronic pain that arises from running.
It’s a two-stage plan, but you can enact both stages simultaneously:
 
1. When chronic pain rears its ugly head, study your mechanics and positions to determine the
root cause(s) of the problem. Realize that a pain in the arch of your foot can be an
expression of weakness and imbalance in your glutes and lower back, for example. Go
through the position standards: neutral feet, a good squat, hip flexion, hip extension, and
the mobility of your feet and ankles.
2. Position and mechanics come first; treating the symptoms is your second priority. Work on
the problem area, but also above and below the problem, or “upstream and downstream.”
If you have a knee pain, for example, spend time each day working below (calves) and
above (hamstrings, quads, glutes). The idea is to give the problem area some breathing
room by creating slack. Feed slack into the system, use VooDoo Floss Band compression
(see here) for any hotspot inflammation, and work on those sticky sliding surfaces on the
hotspot.
If, after you’ve done this work, you’re not seeing a change (although you likely will), it’s time to
take an account of what you’ve tried and the results and have a talk with your trusted sports medicine
healthcare provider.
To give you a snapshot of how to use this approach, here are some common chronic running
injuries and how you might work on each of them.
PLANTAR FASCIITIS
Plantar fasciitis, the debilitating scourge of runners and athletes everywhere. The plantar fascia is a
big sheet of connective tissue on the bottom of the foot. It is shaped like a triangle and tapers into the
heel, where it connects to the heel bone.
 
Plantar fasciitis is sort of a catchall phrase for any chronic pain in this area of the foot. It could be
from a nerve ending getting caught, for example, or an inflamed bursa sac. The bottom line is that it
hurts every time you plant your foot on the ground, which does real wonders for your running.
When you have pain, you need to attack the problem like the athlete you are. Your first order of
business is to begin analyzing the underlying cause within your mechanics. Heel strikers everywhere
are courting chronic arch pain on a daily basis. It can also be a manifestation of weak hips and poor
midline stability.
Also pay attention to the dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of your foot—if you’re short in your range
of motion (as testing for Standard #7 will reveal), then this is going to feed into arch pain. If plantar
fasciitis is on your resume, then make the Ankle Range of Motion standard a priority.
To alleviate the immediate issue, you need to work upstream and downstream of the problem. This
means selecting mobility exercises that treat your toes, particularly the mobility of your big toe, as
well as your heel cords and calf muscles. Doing so will start giving slack to the system.
Also, get your V
oodoo Floss Band involved to speed the healing process. Perform V
ooDoo Floss
Band compression (see here). Wrap up your arch and spend a few minutes flexing and pointing your
foot. This will floss through the sliding surfaces and aid your lymphatic system.
It’s also time to use a Yoga Tune Up ball or lacrosse ball directly on the tissues of your arch. Refer
to the foot exercises beginning here.
Look for those ropy hotspots that are shortening your system. Roll deeply into these places. You
need to get some suppleness back into the arch of your foot. Build this work into your day, but first
and foremost do it before getting out of bed and putting weight on your bare foot. Think of it as
adhering to the Warming Up standard.
ILIOTIBIAL BAND SYNDROME
Like plantar fasciitis, IT band syndrome is another catchall name for injuries related to the IT band. It
usually refers to a hotspot of pain on the outside of the knee. It’s also usually a runner’s problem.
 
The IT band is crazy. I recall my amazement at how thick it was when I peeled one out of a cadaver
for the first time. It attaches to basically everything—your glutes, your hamstrings, and your quads.
So study your mechanics. Look for movement faults. IT band syndrome is usually a result of weak
hips and a valgus knee problem where the joint is collapsing inward and you’re swinging your foot
around for a wretched heel strike.
Don’t think that you can “stretch out” the IT band. It’s so heavy-duty that you could use it to suspend
a V
olkswagen! Instead, feed slack back into the system by working upstream and downstream of the
problem. Really dig into your high hip area, the side of your hip in particular. You can also generate
slack by mobilizing your hamstring and quads (see here). Use V
ooDoo Floss Band compression (see
here) on any inflamed hotspots.
Place a ball in the crook of your knee and flex your leg around it for some flexion gapping (see
here) for relief. Beware of the neuromuscular bundle behind your knee—if you feel a weird, nervy
pain, back off and move the ball. You don’t want to mess with that.
RUNNER’S KNEE
This rotten ailment causes pain on the inside of the knee with each footfall. Let’s start with mechanics.
Runner’s knee is often an expression of—you guessed it—poor mechanics. The foot isn’t neutral, the
knee collapses inward, and you mess with the connective tissues and cartilage within the joint.
 
Fix your position and support it by looking for missing range of motion—namely hip flexion and
hip extension.
Perform V
ooDoo Floss Band compression (see here) around your knee, moving the joint through its
full range of motion. Mobilize upstream and downstream to open up slack—calves, shins, hamstrings,
quads—and blast into those glutes.
SHIN SPLINTS
Shin splints are a nasty affliction for runners, soccer players, basketball players, and other athletes
who engage in sports that involve a lot of running, especially on a hard surface like a track or court.
 
You should know the plan by now: Examine your positions and mechanics and work on fixing them.
Get out that V
ooDoo Floss Band, wrap it around the problem area, and spend some time pointing and
flexing your foot.
Speaking of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion—pepper your mobility work with lower leg and hip
mobilizations.
Place a lacrosse ball between your shin and the ground (check the mobility exercises on this—see
here) and slowly work that anterior compartment, up and down between your ankle and your knee.
Finally, create slack upstream and downstream by working on your heel cord, the bottom of your
foot, your big toe, and your upper leg.
CHAPTER 19
TURBOCHARGED SPORTS MEDICINE
 
I want to assure you of two principles that I completely believe in and hope you take away from this
book. At first glance, these principles seem to be at right angles to one another, but in fact they work
together like the alloy of iron and carbon.
 
Principle #1: All human beings should be able to perform basic maintenance on
themselves.
 
Your first step on the journey toward higher performance and injury prevention is to understand and
appreciate how much value you can get out of just 10 to 15 minutes a day of working toward
achieving and maintaining the standards presented in this book. It’s not the job of a sports medicine
professional or a running shoe salesperson to take care of your tissues and joints, the positions you
practice throughout the day, whether you hydrate or not, and whether you’re actively working toward
retaining normal ranges of motion in your feet, ankles, legs, hips, and back. It’s your job, and you
want it to be your job. By accepting this responsibility, you’ll immediately gain several things:
 
Y
ou can be on this job 24 hours a day.
Y
ou will get an invaluable education from exploring your mechanics, unveiling problems,
and creating mobilizations of your own.
Y
ou will learn a new, individualized language of movement and mechanics that will come
into play during training and in the toughest moments of a challenging endurance event.
When your form starts to fall to pieces, you’ll know how to reorganize in a way that will
keep you going.
Finally, this knowledge will equip you well when you do need to visit a physical therapist, clinic,
or sports massage therapist. Rather than just filling out an insurance form and off-loading the problem
to someone else, you’ll be able to ensure that you’re getting what you’re paying for.
Which leads us to the second principle:
Principle #2: When you visit a chiropractor, physical therapist, sports medicine clinic,
or other body worker, go in with some hard-won knowledge to share.
 
When the PT asks what you have done so far to deal with the problem, be ready to answer with a
list—the mobilizations you’ve been working on, the use of compression, changes in your mechanics,
and anything else you’ve tried in performing basic maintenance on yourself.
First of all, this list will blow the therapist’s mind. Why? Because I can tell you from experience. I
always ask my physical therapy clients this question, and almost every time they answer with one sad
and empty word: “Nothing.”
If you go into a clinic with a couple of pages from your training journal in hand that detail what
you’ve tried, what’s worked, and what hasn’t worked, then your PT is going to have a 100-mile head
start in helping you solve the problem. It’s going to empower her with so much quality information
that she will be able to zero in.
So, yes, I want you to take the challenge of performing basic maintenance on your body, but this
doesn’t mean that I want you to avoid clinicians. Rather, the ideal scenario is to find a physiotherapist
who is very good and very committed to helping you achieve optimal health and performance, and
then develop a long-term relationship and a running dialogue.
Another reason for the No Days Off policy (see here) is that your battle to realize all 12 standards
presented in this book and achieve optimal mobility is never over. It’s a lifelong process. And
enlisting the help of a trusted expert who has a stake in your long-term health and performance is
invaluable. Not only will you get a lot more bang for your healthcare buck, but the process should
also help you steer clear of some of the major problems that can convert a runner into a specialist on
the elliptical trainer.
So take up this challenge: The next time you plan a visit to a sports medicine professional, go in
with as much information as you can about the maintenance work you are doing. Go in with the
challenge of blowing her mind. When she sees how committed you are to doing the work, you’ll get
that much more thought and effort in return.
A PARTING WORD
 
Not long ago, a sound engineer based in San Francisco trained for and ran in the Avenue of the Giants
half-marathon through the redwood forests of northern California. A husband and father of two
daughters, he saw the training and the event as part of a concentrated return to the health and fitness
that he had lost while attending to the demands of young children and a job that, when deadlines came
around, had him working long hours hunched over the sound board. He loved the training. He loved
the community he found at the race. He couldn’t find the right pacer in the race and ended up going on
feel—which turned out to be faster than he intended. He hit the wall during the last miles, but he had
built up such a buffer in the first half of the race that it didn’t matter. He beat his goal, finishing in
under two hours.
 
It was an all-around win—except for one thing: He contracted a case of shin splits. The engineer
was unable to resume his running because of the splicing pain that shot up through his lower leg with
each foot strike.
So, in an experience that is common to a lot of runners, CrossFitters, and athletes of all stripes, he
went to see his doctor. He described his problem and the pain.
The doctor’s response? (Can you guess?) A shrug of the shoulders and the following prescription:
“Stop running.”
Relatively new to running, the sound engineer thought: Geez. Is that it? Am I already done?
No, he’s not.
To add a little further thought to the preceding chapter, as an athlete, you need to make a distinction
when it comes to seeing an MD for a problem or pain. If you have a weird, sketchy pain or illness, a
visit to your physician is how you take severe illness possibilities off the table. Is an ache in your foot
related to some mild inflammation in your heel or a stress fracture? Or, if you have deep pain in your
femur, you want to make sure that you’re not dealing with bone cancer.
As an athlete, you need to make a distinction when it comes to seeing an MD for a
problem or pain. Once you’ve taken health-threatening (or life-threatening)
possibilities off the table, then you can ignore the doctor’s advice to stop running.
 
But once you’ve taken such health-threatening (or life-threatening) possibilities off the table and
you know that it’s a nagging pain due to the running-related beating you’ve given yourself, you can
ignore the doctor’s advice to stop running. As super-running MD Tim Noakes advises, never take
such advice as final if it’s coming from a doctor who is not an athlete.
In the case of the sound engineer, it would be ridiculous for him to dump his newfound love of
being an athlete because of a bout of shin splints. A simple and effective fix for him is going to start
with developing neutral feet and adding some strength and suppleness to the tissues of his feet and
ankles (jumping rope and spending some time smashing and flossing those tissues would be helpful
first steps). But unfortunately, he’ll have to sort through a lot of confusing information before deciding
what to do. Some people might tell him that he should stop running. Others will tell him, “You need
different running shoes.”
To come full circle, I want to emphasize again that you, as an athlete, have the power to attend to
90 percent of your maintenance needs on your own. Sure, you want to deal with the symptoms, but you
have to invest time and effort in effecting the deep repairs to your mechanics, the positions you use,
and your ability to get into those positions.
I’ve thrown a lot of information at you and made a lot of requests of you in this book. Both the
general concepts and the demands embedded in the 12 standards I’ve tasked you to chase may seem
overwhelming. And I know that asking you to wedge even 10 minutes into your day, every day, might
set off an alarm. Here you are again, being asked to do one more thing. But I’m confident that if you
play around with some of these ideas and techniques, you’ll find the rewards energizing. You’ll want
to do more and learn more and experiment more.
I don’t want you to close this book without at least getting this taste and the traction therein. So if
time is one thing you have very, very little of, please at least commit to one week of this work. Take it
for a test run. I’m asking for only a few minutes each day. I want you to give the work your best effort
and pay attention to the changes you feel. I’m confident that once you gain some exposure to it, you’ll
want to make the time to dedicate yourself to the program full blast.
You can go through this week to get a feel for what the movement and mobility program is all
about, and then, if you sense some positive changes and want to go deeper, you can spring right into
testing yourself against the standards and beginning the journey toward being Ready to Run.
SAMPLE WEEK OF MOVEMENT AND MOBILITY WORK
 
RUNNING POWER: YOUR CONTINUING
EDUCATION
 
Running is the movement that links athletes together. You play football, you run. You’re a triathlete,
you run. You’re a CrossFitter, you run. You throw the Frisbee, you run. But a common problem is that
an athlete puts in the time to refine all the various other skills involved in his or her sport but doesn’t
give running the same brand of study. There seems to be a belief that, Hey, I’m fit from all the
training; my running is good enough. But you and I both know that if you are not meeting the 12
standards—if you don’t have enough ankle range of motion or you’re lacking hip function—you can’t
run well. And if you can’t run well, you can’t run fast, or you can’t run at all because you’re injured.
 
Your pursuit and maintenance of the Ready to Run standards will be an ongoing process, and it
will require you to be creative, thoughtful, and attentive. Do you need to max out all 12 standards to
realize your running talent? Maybe not, but there’s something to be said for grabbing as much as you
can. When I get in the car for a drive, I prefer to have a full tank of gas, even if I’m just going across
town. There’s a buffer involved, and it frees me up to think and work on other things.
So let’s talk about your continuing education. Where do you go from here? After you’re on the road
to meeting the 12 standards, invest in a CrossFit Endurance or Pose Tech seminar and commit to
mastering your mechanics. Being Ready to Run, you’ll be able to use the right positions to master the
correct patterns of movement. It’s a killer one-two punch.
Second, keep checking in at MobilityWOD.com. It’s the place where we take the conversations we
have at the dinner table—conversations about solving athletic performance problems and realizing
human potential—and play around with the ideas we come up with. The following are some of the
classic MWODs that will help you dial in the underlying concepts and techniques of this book.
Unglue Y
our Sticks
A full-scale attack on the sliding surface dysfunction and all-around stiffness that tend to plague
athletes who put in a lot of running, jumping, and landing work. This is how you unglue it all.
www.mobilitywod.com/2010/11/episode-85-unglue-your-sticks-man/
 
Extension Dimension
Being tight in the high hip area can lead to limitations in how well you can internally rotate that leg. If
extension and internal rotation are suffocating, you’ll have a difficult time using your hamstring
properly, and your foot will tend to swing and sway in abnormal, power-leaking patterns. This video
shows you how to loosen it up.
www.mobilitywod.com/2011/01/episode-151365-runnersplit-jerk-dream.html
 
Smoking Brakes
Running downhill tends to burn out your quads and the accompanying muscles that take a beating from
hard, hilly runs. Here’s the antidote.
www.mobilitywod.com/2010/09/episdoe-23-runners-legs/
 
Dehydration Nation
As I’ve said, you are a system of systems. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, and where there’s fire,
there are dehydrated, beef jerky–like calf muscles. It’s time to kill the thirst.
www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-213365-recovering-your-jumping-calves.html
 
Y
our Springs
If you want to understand why your feet can get so mashed up, consider all the work they do. Then
take an anatomy class and skin a cadaver’s foot to understand how much is going on in there. Or
watch this video.
www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-220365-lower-leg-business.html
 
Heel Cord Love
Going to a CrossFit Endurance or Pose Method seminar? Get ready by watching this video and
preparing your lower legs for the sea change to come.
www.mobilitywod.com/2011/04/episode-237365-heel-cord-love.html
 
Medial Chain Business
I talk a lot about the posterior chain, but let’s not forget about the medial chain—the groin and inner
thigh—and what goes on terms of overall mechanics: systems of systems of systems.
www.mobilitywod.com/2011/05/episode-241365-sumo-and-medial-chain-business.html
 
Hamstring Heaven
Stretching is tired. Need to breathe some power into your hamstrings? Grab a Superfriend and
prepare for your new legs.

IT Band and the Kitchen Sink
If you have a so-called “IT band problem,” watch this video before you freak out about the shoes
you’re wearing.

Squat Power
If you think that attaining the squatting standard is beyond you, tell it to my aunt—a five-time Ironman
Masters triathlete who understands how to do the squat test with the ultimate Paleo timer (since
Cavemen didn’t have clocks).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First among the people responsible for the completion of this project whom I need to thank is T.J.
Murphy. Still my most famous friend, now I will have to add “most talented and able friend” to that
moniker. If the world really understood your rain-man-like abilities to both write and regurgitate
esoteric running lore, you would be persecuted as the real-life Professor Charles Xavier genius-
mutant you really are. Thank you for your kindness, flexibility, friendship, talent, and incredible
ability to turn the boat around and head directly into the storm. And Gretchen Weber, don’t think we
aren’t aware that you are the keel that keeps that boat from blowing off course and onto the rocks.
 
Thanks also to Brian MacKenzie, who gave me back running and introduced me to T.J. I appreciate
that you knew how special I was that I could simultaneously pull and heel strike while wearing 40-
pound shoes. Your faith and ability to teach such a foundational human skill, when so many people
couldn’t see the forest for the trees, has literally given countless people back a chunk of their
humanity. Who knew that your life’s work was really about standing in the breach on behalf of those
of us who didn’t know any better? If this is really a book about public health, then you are the guy
who showed me I didn’t have to run in squalor.
 
Tom Wiscombe, you may be the only true genius I know. I am so grateful that the older brother I
always longed for is actually related to me, and freaky talented. Juliet and I would be greatly
diminished without your voice, eye, honesty, and advocacy.
 
Dave Beatie, Susan Crane, and Christopher Jerard are the spine and vital organs of MWOD. An
organism is pretty worthless if it can’t interact with its environment and take care of itself. We
wouldn’t be able to perform either function without you. I’m not sure how we tricked you all onto the
team, but I’m glad we did.
 
Darren Miller and John Segesta, thank you for leveraging your considerable talents to make this book
so damn sexy.
 
Thank you to the many professionals that we interviewed, quoted, or stood on the shoulders of to
make this book more than it otherwise could have been.
 
And finally, thank you to my family for the love and support required to be modern, working-adult
humans and raise two amazing girls.
